8057077,"Inward rectifier (IR) K+ channels of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells were studied using the whole-cell, cell-attached, and outside-out patch-clamp configurations. The effects of Rb+ on the voltage dependence and kinetics of IR gating were explored, with [Rb+]o + [K+]o = 160 mM. Partial substitution of Rb+ for K+ resulted in voltage-dependent reduction of inward currents, consistent with Rb+ being a weakly permeant blocker of the IR. In cells studied with a K(+)-free pipette solution, external Rb+ reduced inward IR currents to a similar extent at large negative potentials but block at more positive potentials was enhanced. In outside-out patches, the single-channel i-V relationship was approximately linear in symmetrical K+, but rectified strongly outwardly in high [Rb+]o due to a reduced conductance for inward current. The permeability of Rb+ based on reversal potential, Vrev, was 0.45 that of K+, whereas the Rb+ conductance was much lower, 0.034 that of K+, measured at Vrev-80 mV. The steady state voltage-dependence of IR gating was determined in Rb(+)-containing solutions by applying variable prepulses, followed by a test pulse to a potential at which outward current deactivation was observed. As [Rb+]o was increased, the half-activation potential, V1/2, changed less than Vrev. In high [K+]o solutions V1/2 was Vrev-6 mV, while in high [Rb+]o V1/2 was Vrev + 7 mV. This behavior contrasts with the classical parallel shift of V1/2 with Vrev in K+ solutions. Steady state IR gating was less steeply voltage-dependent in high [Rb+]o than in K+ solutions, with Boltzmann slope factors of 6.4 and 4.4 mV, respectively. Rb+ decreased (slowed) both activation and deactivation rate constants defined at V1/2, and decreased the steepness of the voltage dependence of the activation rate constant by 42%. Deactivation of IR channels in outside-out patches was also slowed by Rb+. In summary, Rb+ can replace K+ in setting the voltage-dependence of IR gating, but in doing so alters the kinetics.",valid
27168519,"Self-harm (SH; intentional self-poisoning or self-injury) is common, often repeated, and associated with suicide. This is an update of a broader Cochrane review first published in 1998, previously updated in 1999, and now split into three separate reviews. This review focuses on psychosocial interventions in adults who engage in self-harm. To assess the effects of specific psychosocial treatments versus treatment as usual, enhanced usual care or other forms of psychological therapy, in adults following SH. The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials coordinator searched the CCDAN Clinical Trials Register (to 29 April 2015). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We included RCTs comparing psychosocial treatments with treatment as usual (TAU), enhanced usual care (EUC) or alternative treatments in adults with a recent (within six months) episode of SH resulting in presentation to clinical services. We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures. We included 55 trials, with a total of 17,699 participants. Eighteen trials investigated cognitive-behavioural-based psychotherapy (CBT-based psychotherapy; comprising cognitive-behavioural, problem-solving therapy or both). Nine investigated interventions for multiple repetition of SH/probable personality disorder, comprising emotion-regulation group-based psychotherapy, mentalisation, and dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT). Four investigated case management, and 11 examined remote contact interventions (postcards, emergency cards, telephone contact). Most other interventions were evaluated in only single small trials of moderate to very low quality.There was a significant treatment effect for CBT-based psychotherapy compared to TAU at final follow-up in terms of fewer participants repeating SH (odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.88; number of studies k = 17; N = 2665; GRADE: low quality evidence), but with no reduction in frequency of SH (mean difference (MD) -0.21, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.26; k = 6; N = 594; GRADE: low quality).For interventions typically delivered to individuals with a history of multiple episodes of SH/probable personality disorder, group-based emotion-regulation psychotherapy and mentalisation were associated with significantly reduced repetition when compared to TAU: group-based emotion-regulation psychotherapy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.88; k = 2; N = 83; GRADE: low quality), mentalisation (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.73; k = 1; N = 134; GRADE: moderate quality). Compared with TAU, dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) showed a significant reduction in frequency of SH at final follow-up (MD -18.82, 95% CI -36.68 to -0.95; k = 3; N = 292; GRADE: low quality) but not in the proportion of individuals repeating SH (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.59, k = 3; N = 247; GRADE: low quality). Compared with an alternative form of psychological therapy, DBT-oriented therapy was also associated with a significant treatment effect for repetition of SH at final follow-up (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.49; k = 1; N = 24; GRADE: low quality). However, neither DBT vs 'treatment by expert' (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.95; k = 1; N = 97; GRADE: very low quality) nor prolonged exposure DBT vs standard exposure DBT (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.68; k = 1; N =18; GRADE: low quality) were associated with a significant reduction in repetition of SH.Case management was not associated with a significant reduction in repetition of SH at post intervention compared to either TAU or enhanced usual care (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.30; k = 4; N = 1608; GRADE: moderate quality). Continuity of care by the same therapist vs a different therapist was also not associated with a significant treatment effect for repetition (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.10; k = 1; N = 136; GRADE: very low quality). None of the following remote contact interventions were associated with fewer participants repeating SH compared with TAU: adherence enhancement (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.02; k = 1; N = 391; GRADE: low quality), mixed multimodal interventions (comprising psychological therapy and remote contact-based interventions) (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43; k = 1 study; N = 684; GRADE: low quality), including a culturally adapted form of this intervention (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.55; k = 1; N = 167; GRADE: low quality), postcards (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.23; k = 4; N = 3277; GRADE: very low quality), emergency cards (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.14; k = 2; N = 1039; GRADE: low quality), general practitioner's letter (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.44; k = 1; N = 1932; GRADE: moderate quality), telephone contact (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.32; k = 3; N = 840; GRADE: very low quality), and mobile telephone-based psychological therapy (OR not estimable due to zero cell counts; GRADE: low quality).None of the following mixed interventions were associated with reduced repetition of SH compared to either alternative forms of psychological therapy: interpersonal problem-solving skills training, behaviour therapy, home-based problem-solving therapy, long-term psychotherapy; or to TAU: provision of information and support, treatment for alcohol misuse, intensive inpatient and community treatment, general hospital admission, or intensive outpatient treatment.We had only limited evidence on whether the intervention had different effects in men and women. Data on adverse effects, other than planned outcomes relating to suicidal behaviour, were not reported. CBT-based psychological therapy can result in fewer individuals repeating SH; however, the quality of this evidence, assessed using GRADE criteria, ranged between moderate and low. Dialectical behaviour therapy for people with multiple episodes of SH/probable personality disorder may lead to a reduction in frequency of SH, but this finding is based on low quality evidence. Case management and remote contact interventions did not appear to have any benefits in terms of reducing repetition of SH. Other therapeutic approaches were mostly evaluated in single trials of moderate to very low quality such that the evidence relating to these interventions is inconclusive.",valid

27353385,"Young women, especially adolescents, often lack access to modern contraception. Reasons vary by geography and regional politics and culture. The projected 2015 birth rate in 'developing' regions was 56 per 1000 compared with 17 per 1000 for 'developed' regions. To identify school-based interventions that improved contraceptive use among adolescents Until 6 June 2016, we searched for eligible trials in PubMed, CENTRAL, ERIC, Web of Science, POPLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assigned individuals or clusters. The majority of participants must have been 19 years old or younger.The educational strategy must have occurred primarily in a middle school or high school. The intervention had to emphasize one or more effective methods of contraception. Our primary outcomes were pregnancy and contraceptive use. We assessed titles and abstracts identified during the searches. One author extracted and entered the data into RevMan; a second author verified accuracy. We examined studies for methodological quality.For unadjusted dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For cluster randomized trials, we used adjusted measures, e.g. OR, risk ratio, or difference in proportions. For continuous outcomes, we used the adjusted mean difference (MD) or other measures from the models. We did not conduct meta-analysis due to varied interventions and outcome measures. The 11 trials included 10 cluster RCTs and an individually randomized trial. The cluster RCTs had sample sizes from 816 to 10,954; the median number of clusters was 24. Most trials were conducted in the USA and UK; one was from Mexico and one from South Africa.We focus here on the trials with moderate quality evidence and an intervention effect. Three addressed preventing pregnancy and HIV/STI through interactive sessions. One trial provided a multifaceted two-year program. Immediately after year one and 12 months after year two, the intervention group was more likely than the standard-curriculum group to report using effective contraception during last sex (reported adjusted ORs 1.62 ± standard error (SE) 0.22) and 1.76 ± SE 0.29), condom use during last sex (reported adjusted ORs 1.91 ± SE 0.27 and 1.68 ± SE 0.25), and less frequent sex without a condom in the past three months (reported ratios of adjusted means 0.50 ± SE 0.31 and 0.63 ± SE 0.23). Another trial compared multifaceted two-year programs on sexual risk reduction and risk avoidance (abstinence-focused) versus usual health education. At 3 months, the risk reduction group was less likely than the usual-education group to report no condom use at last intercourse (reported adjusted OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.96) and sex without a condom in the last three months (reported adjusted OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.95). At 3 and after 15 months, the risk avoidance group was also less likely than the usual-education group to report no condom use at last intercourse (reported adjusted ORs 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.93; and 0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.85). At the same time points, the risk reduction group had a higher score than the usual-education group for condom knowledge. The third trial provided a peer-led program with eight interactive sessions. At 17 months, the intervention group was less likely than the teacher-led group to report oral contraceptive use during last sex (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.91). This difference may not have been significant if the investigators had adjusted for the clustering. At 5 and 17 months, the peer-led group had a greater mean increase in knowledge of HIV and pregnancy prevention compared with the control group. An additional trial showed an effect on knowledge only. The group with an emergency contraception (EC) session was more likely than the group without the EC unit to know the time limits for using hormonal EC (pill) and the non-hormonal IUD as EC. Since most trials addressed preventing STI/HIV and pregnancy, they emphasized condom use. However, several studies covered a range of contraceptive methods. The overall quality of evidence was low. Main reasons for downgrading the evidence were having limited information on intervention fidelity, analyzing a subsample rather than all those randomized, and having high losses.",valid

32272430,"Object recognition is a primary function of the human visual system. It has recently been claimed that the highly successful ability to recognise objects in a set of emergent computer vision systems-Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs)-can form a useful guide to recognition in humans. To test this assertion, we systematically evaluated visual crowding, a dramatic breakdown of recognition in clutter, in DCNNs and compared their performance to extant research in humans. We examined crowding in three architectures of DCNNs with the same methodology as that used among humans. We manipulated multiple stimulus factors including inter-letter spacing, letter colour, size, and flanker location to assess the extent and shape of crowding in DCNNs. We found that crowding followed a predictable pattern across architectures that was different from that in humans. Some characteristic hallmarks of human crowding, such as invariance to size, the effect of target-flanker similarity, and confusions between target and flanker identities, were completely missing, minimised or even reversed. These data show that DCNNs, while proficient in object recognition, likely achieve this competence through a set of mechanisms that are distinct from those in humans. They are not necessarily equivalent models of human or primate object recognition and caution must be exercised when inferring mechanisms derived from their operation.",valid
17722706,"It takes years for microvascular complications in diabetes mellitus such as diabetic retinopathy (RP) and nephropathy (NP) to develop. Since retinal and renal vessels are exposed to the diabetic milieu, it is often assumed that progression of diabetic RP and NP occurs at the same time. However, smaller studies have demonstrated that this may not always be the case. The present study was undertaken to correlate diabetic retinopathy with parameters of renal function in a large ambulatory collective of patients with Types 1 and 2 diabetes. The study design was cross-sectional. Ambulatory patients from a large university out-patient clinic were studied (323 patients with Type 1, 906 patients with Type 2 diabetes). RP status was obtained through retinal photography by an experienced ophthalmologist and was grouped into no RP, RP Stages 1-3, or blind. Retinal pathology was correlated with clinical parameters of renal function (proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate according to the MDRD formula, presence of urinary sediment abnormalities, hypertension). No patient showed urinary sediment abnormalities (e.g. presence of hematuria or acanthocytes) or increased urinary excretion of immunoglobulin light chains suggesting the absence of other nondiabetic renal diseases. The majority of Type 1 diabetes patients with macroalbuminuria (> or = 200 mg/l) had some signs of RP independent of the presence of hypertension. There was a correlation between RP and microalbuminuria (r = 0.164, p < 0.01). In contrast, up to 47.5% of the hypertensive patients with Type 2 diabetes and overt proteinuria had no signs of RP. There was also discordance of microalbuminuria and RP in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Stratification according to K/DOQI States 2-5 (MDRD formula) showed that the majority of patients with Type 1 diabetes in States 3-5 had signs of RP, albeit the absolute number of patients in these K/DOQI stages was very small. In contrast, up to 40% of dialysis-dependent Type 2 diabetics (K/DOQI State 5) showed no evidence of RP. This study revealed that many patients with Type 2 diabetes and renal abnormalities (proteinuria and/or renal insufficiency) showed, in contrast to Type 1 diabetics, no signs of RP. Our study was, however, limited by the lack of renal biopsies. Although urinary sediment analysis was normal in these patients, other causes for renal insufficiency (e.g. vascular nephropathy), especially in Type 2 diabetics, cannot be excluded. Nevertheless, we believe that absence of RP in patients with Type 2 diabetes does not imply that renal abnormalities including diabetic nephropathy, are also absent. It is recommended that these patients undergo renal biopsy.",valid
38084334,"To conduct the first scoping review of lumbosacral neuroforaminal stenosis with respect to the pathophysiology, symptomatic manifestations, diagnostic imaging, and treatment options. A scoping literature review was conducted in accordance with the recommendations set forth by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), with English language restrictions stipulated to include articles pertaining to lumbosacral neuroforaminal stenosis. Databases maintained by PubMed, National Library of Medicine, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Ovid), Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), and Google Scholar were queried from their inception date through December 2022. A total of 276 articles were reviewed and 29 articles were included within the study. Within these articles, the anatomic origins of neuroforaminal stenosis were reviewed in detail and the resulting clinical manifestations were discussed. Recent studies evaluating the efficacy of existing diagnostic imaging modalities were summarized, along with potential future methods to improve sensitivity for detecting this entity and measuring foraminal stenosis via novel imaging techniques. Based on the literature, the conservative management and surgical treatment of lumbosacral foraminal stenosis were discussed. Lumbar neuroforaminal stenosis represents a significant source of radicular pain that is often compounded by delayed diagnosis and incomplete treatment. This article represents the first scoping review of lumbosacral neuroforaminal stenosis with focus on diagnosis, management, and treatment for associated radicular pain. The goal is to reduce the incidence of untreated or unrecognized neuroforaminal stenosis in the setting of a complex decompression and fusion, as well as to promote minimally invasive surgery to address radicular pain from neuroforaminal stenosis. Recent advances in diagnostic imaging and surgical techniques have the potential to improve the timeliness and durability of patients' treatment options. Future directions for the diagnostic imaging of foraminal stenosis include efforts aimed at developing the nascent field of computerized mapping to reliably quantify stenosis and its impact on the exiting nerve root and associated dorsal root ganglia.",valid
37150779,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the field of medical imaging and has the potential to bring medicine from the era of 'sick-care' to the era of healthcare and prevention. The development of AI requires access to large, complete, and harmonized real-world datasets, representative of the population, and disease diversity. However, to date, efforts are fragmented, based on single-institution, size-limited, and annotation-limited datasets. Available public datasets (e.g., The Cancer Imaging Archive, TCIA, USA) are limited in scope, making model generalizability really difficult. In this direction, five European Union projects are currently working on the development of big data infrastructures that will enable European, ethically and General Data Protection Regulation-compliant, quality-controlled, cancer-related, medical imaging platforms, in which both large-scale data and AI algorithms will coexist. The vision is to create sustainable AI cloud-based platforms for the development, implementation, verification, and validation of trustable, usable, and reliable AI models for addressing specific unmet needs regarding cancer care provision. In this paper, we present an overview of the development efforts highlighting challenges and approaches selected providing valuable feedback to future attempts in the area.Key points• Artificial intelligence models for health imaging require access to large amounts of harmonized imaging data and metadata.• Main infrastructures adopted either collect centrally anonymized data or enable access to pseudonymized distributed data.• Developing a common data model for storing all relevant information is a challenge.• Trust of data providers in data sharing initiatives is essential.• An online European Union meta-tool-repository is a necessity minimizing effort duplication for the various projects in the area.",valid

31030749,"Heparin is an anticoagulant medication that was discovered in 1917 and used in clinic since 1935. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) represent a refined use of heparin as anticoagulant medications that were developed in 1980s. LMWHs are obtained by cleaving heparin with different chemical or enzymatic methods. Eight chemically distinct and officially approved LMWHs are Bemiparin, Certoparin, Dalteparin, Enoxaparin, Nadroparin, Parnaparin, Reviparin, and Tinzaparin. LMWHs are mainly used for preventing blood clots, for treating deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and for treating myocardial infarction. LMWHs have advantages over heparin in that they can be used at home with good predictability, dose-dependent plasma levels, a long half-life, less bleeding for a given antithrombotic even, smaller risk of osteoporosis in long-term use, and smaller risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, a potential side effect of heparin. However, heparin is reversible with protamine sulfate while LMWHs have no antidote. Moreover, LMWHs have less of an effect on inhibiting thrombin activity than heparin. Furthermore, patients with end-stage renal diseases have to use heparin because LMWHs are dependent on functioning kidney for their clearance but heparin is primarily cleared in the liver. We will review the recent progress made on the clinically approved and under clinical trialed LMWHs and their potential medical applications. In particular, we will provide an update on the chemical characteristics and clinical use of different branded LMWHs. In addition, the potential clinical applications of LMWHs in other therapeutic area will also be discussed.",valid

23352618,"Haptic information, provided by a non-rigid tool (i.e., an ""anchor system""), can reduce body sway in individuals who perform a standing postural task. However, it was not known whether or not continuous use of the anchor system would improve postural control after its removal. Additionally, it was unclear as to whether or not frequency of use of the anchor system is related to improved control in older adults. The present study evaluated the effect of the prolonged use of the anchor system on postural control in healthy older individuals, at different frequencies of use, while they performed a postural control task (semi-tandem position). Participants were divided into three groups according to the frequency of the anchor system's use (0%, 50%, and 100%). Pre-practice phase (without anchor) was followed by a practice phase (they used the anchor system at the predefined frequency), and a post-practice phase (immediate and late-without anchor). All three groups showed a persistent effect 15min after the end of the practice phase (immediate post-practice phase). However, only the 50% group showed a persistent effect in the late post-practice phase (24h after finishing the practice phase). Older adults can improve their postural control by practicing the standing postural task, and use of the anchor system limited to half of their practice time can provide additional improvement in their postural control.",valid
35836323,"The incidence of feeding and eating problems and disorders (FEPD) in children increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young children with FEPD and their parents. Cross-sectional survey: parents of children with FEPD (0-11 years) in the Netherlands completed an online questionnaire (January-April 2021). This questionnaire included 4 demographic questions (including criteria of pediatric feeding disorder [PFD] and/or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder [ARFID]) and 11 questions related to experienced impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Parental responses regarding children with FEPD (including PFD and ARFID) were compared with those of healthy controls (HCs). In total, 240 children (median age, 5.5 years; interquartile range [IQR], 3.5-7.9 years; 53.3% female) were included; 129 children with FEPD and 111 HC. Most children with FEPD fulfilled criteria for PFD (n = 119; 92.2%) and/or ARFID (n = 117; 90.7%). Parents of children with FEPD reported more stress (of their child [ P = 0.014] and parental stress [ P = 0.014]), worse eating by the child ( P &lt; 0.001), more negative relations within the family ( P = 0.006), and less support from the environment ( P = 0.001) compared with parents of HC during the COVID-19 pandemic than before. It seems that the COVID-19 pandemic had great impact on young children with FEPD and their parents because parents of children with FEPD reported significantly more perceived stress within both the child and parents, more difficult eating behavior of the child, more negative behavior between family members, and less support from the environment as compared with HC.",valid

SSOM differed from TM in preciseness of evaluation criteria, training of evaluator, and amount of direct observation of clinical performance. SSOM appeared to be a more precise measurement instrument than TM and far more sensitive to the detection of clinical improvement. The study documents the significant contribution of a nurse-educator to the evaluation process, as this contribution correlates well with TM yet provides a unique and independent perspective. Finally, SSOM of evaluation correlated significantly with oral examination and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) test results.

7049964,"Tc99m labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Tc-99m-DTPA) is an appropriate in vivo test solute for all extracorporeal detoxification procedures. The molecular weight of the Tc-99m-DTPA complex is within the biologically relevant middle molecular range of 400 to 700 daltons. Tc-99m-DTPA is distributed in the extracellular space in the same way as inulin. Regarding its localization in the gel filtration spectra and plasma clearance, Tc-99m-DTPA corresponds to middle molecule peak 2. The evaluation of elimination rate and plasma clearance CP of Tc-99m-DTPA is possible by measuring the pulse rates before and after the detoxification device. Taking into account the corrections for Ht and UFR, the Tc-99m-DTPA plasma clearances were calculated for different dialyzers, high flux dialyzers, hemofilters and a hemoperfusion device. The continuous measurement of pulse rates and the use of a UFR-controller (A2008) allow an exact tracking of CP vs. time, the estimation of CP (QB), CP(UFR) and of the sieving coefficient. Examples are given for these cases. It was shown that an increase in plasma clearance to more than about 100 ml/min does not greatly increase the Tc-99m-DTPA elimination rate.",valid
30126148,"Hyperspectral sensors, especially the close-range hyperspectral camera, have been widely introduced to detect biological processes of plants in the high-throughput phenotyping platform, to support the identification of biotic and abiotic stress reactions at an early stage. However, the complex geometry of plants and their interaction with the illumination, severely affects the spectral information obtained. Furthermore, plant structure, leaf area, and leaf inclination distribution are critical indexes which have been widely used in multiple plant models. Therefore, the process of combination between hyperspectral images and 3D point clouds is a promising approach to solve these problems and improve the high-throughput phenotyping technique. We proposed a novel approach fusing a low-cost depth sensor and a close-range hyperspectral camera, which extended hyperspectral camera ability with 3D information as a potential tool for high-throughput phenotyping. An exemplary new calibration and analysis method was shown in soybean leaf experiments. The results showed that a 0.99 pixel resolution for the hyperspectral camera and a 3.3 millimeter accuracy for the depth sensor, could be achieved in a controlled environment using the method proposed in this paper. We also discussed the new capabilities gained using this new method, to quantify and model the effects of plant geometry and sensor configuration. The possibility of 3D reflectance models can be used to minimize the geometry-related effects in hyperspectral images, and to significantly improve high-throughput phenotyping. Overall results of this research, indicated that the proposed method provided more accurate spatial and spectral plant information, which helped to enhance the precision of biological processes in high-throughput phenotyping.",valid

The patients were matched for age, body mass index, primary renal disease and dose of prednisolone, but not for the duration in transplantation and serum creatinine concentration. Triglyceride concentrations were significantly higher in the CsA/P group than in Aza/P-treated patients: 2.62 +/- 0.35 vs 1.62 +/- 0.23 mmol/l (P less than 0.05). Similarly, total cholesterol (C) levels were significantly more elevated in the CsA/P recipients than in the other group: 7.44 +/- 0.32 vs 5.84 +/- 0.25 (P less than 0.02). CsA/P patients had higher serum levels of LDL-C (4.79 +/- 0.20 vs 3.43 +/- 0.19 mmol/l (P less than 0.001) and apolipoprotein B concentrations (191 +/- 13 vs 128 +/- 9 mg/dl: P less than 0.001). CsA/P and Aza/P recipients had similar concentrations of HDL-C (1.73 +/- 0.13 vs 1.52 +/- 0.09 mmol/l: NS). We conclude that in stable renal graft recipients with good transplant function long-term immunosuppression with CsA/P is associated with a more atherogenic lipid status than therapy with Aza/P.",valid
27335331,"Survival reflects the accumulation of multiple influences experienced over the life course. Given the amount of time usually spent at work, the influence of work may be particularly important. We examined the association between work-related stress in midlife and subsequent mortality, investigating whether sense of coherence modified the association. Self-reported work-related stress was assessed in 1393 Swedish workers aged 42-65 who participated in the nationally representative Level of Living Survey in 1991. An established psychosocial job exposure matrix was applied to measure occupation-based stress. Sense of coherence was measured as meaningfulness, manageability and comprehensibility. Mortality data were collected from the Swedish National Cause of Death Register. Data were analyzed with hazard regression with Gompertz distributed baseline intensity. After adjustment for socioeconomic position, occupation-based high job strain was associated with higher mortality in the presence of a weak sense of coherence (HR, 3.15; 1.62-6.13), a result that was stronger in women (HR, 4.48; 1.64-12.26) than in men (HR, 2.90; 1.12-7.49). Self-reported passive jobs were associated with higher mortality in the presence of a weak sense of coherence in men (HR, 2.76; 1.16-6.59). The link between work stress and mortality was not significant in the presence of a strong sense of coherence, indicating that a strong sense of coherence buffered the negative effects of work-related stress on mortality. Modifications to work environments that reduce work-related stress may contribute to better health and longer lives, especially in combination with promoting a sense of coherence among workers.",valid

Effects on acne were evaluated as a secondary objective. Results were compared to those of a COC containing drospirenone (DRSP) and ethinylestradiol (EE). Women (aged 18-50 years) were randomised to receive NOMAC/E2 (2.5 mg/1.5 mg) in a 24/4-day regimen (n=1591) or DRSP/EE (3 mg/30 μg) in a 21/7-day regimen (n=535) for 13 cycles. Estimated Pearl Indices for NOMAC/E2 and DRSP/EE were 0.38 and 0.81 in women aged≤35 years and 0.31 and 0.66 for all women (18-50 years), respectively. Scheduled withdrawal bleedings were shorter and lighter among users of NOMAC/E2 and were sometimes absent altogether. Intracyclic bleeding/spotting was infrequent in both groups, and decreased over time. Type and frequency of adverse events were similar to those typically reported for COCs. These data show that NOMAC/E2 provides high contraceptive efficacy with acceptable cycle control as well as an overall adverse event profile similar to that of DRSP/EE.",valid
31467278,"Complementary assays are required to comprehensively map complex biological entities such as genomes, proteomes and interactome networks. However, how various assays can be optimally combined to approach completeness while maintaining high precision often remains unclear. Here, we propose a framework for binary protein-protein interaction (PPI) mapping based on optimally combining assays and/or assay versions to maximize detection of true positive interactions, while avoiding detection of random protein pairs. We have engineered a novel NanoLuc two-hybrid (N2H) system that integrates 12 different versions, differing by protein expression systems and tagging configurations. The resulting union of N2H versions recovers as many PPIs as 10 distinct assays combined. Thus, to further improve PPI mapping, developing alternative versions of existing assays might be as productive as designing completely new assays. Our findings should be applicable to systematic mapping of other biological landscapes.",valid

Pain scores, duration and amount of bleeding, and endometrial thickness were assessed over 10 days. Women who received misoprostol had significantly fewer bleeding days after evacuation (4.11+/-2.69 vs 5.89+/-3.06; P<0.001), fewer patients reported vaginal bleeding lasting 10 days or more (3.8% vs 15.0%; P=0.014), and endometrial thickness 10 days after evacuation was less (6.25+/-2.38 vs 7.23+/-1.94; P=0.05). Pain scores were comparable in both groups (1.54+/-0.65 vs 1.63+/-0.83; P=0.40) after 10 days.

42126,"A new simple method for the preparation of a liquid medium containing rabbit serum for the propagation of Treponema hyodysenteriae and other porcine intestinal spirochaetes is described. The medium, when dispensed in shallow layers and sealed under 10 per cent CO2 in nitrogen, had a redox potential not greater than -125mV and an initial pH of about 6.9 when buffered with bicarbonate. Growth of T hyodysenteriae developed more rapidly and viable counts reached higher levels at 42 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. Viable counts increased at least 10,000-fold after two to five days' incubation, depending on the temperature. Growth could be initiated from small inocula that failed to produce colonies on blood agar.

8789124,"To determine the specific contribution of cytoskeletal proteins to cellular viscoelasticity we performed rheological experiments with Dictyostelium discoideum wild-type cells (AX2) and mutant cells altered by homologous recombination to lack alpha-actinin (AHR), the ABP120 gelation factor (GHR), or both of these F-actin cross-linking proteins (AGHR). Oscillatory and steady flow measurements of Dictyostelium wild-type cells in a torsion pendulum showed that there is a large elastic component to the viscoelasticity of the cell pellet. Quantitative rheological measurements were performed with an electronic plate-and-cone rheometer, which allowed determination of G', the storage shear modulus, and G"", the viscous loss modulus, as a function of time, frequency, and strain, respectively. Whole cell viscoelasticity depends strongly on all three parameters, and comparison of wild-type and mutant strains under identical conditions generally produced significant differences. Especially stress relaxation experiments consistently revealed a clear difference between cells that lacked alpha-actinin as compared with wild-type cells or transformants without ABP120 gelation factor, indicating that alpha-actinin plays an important role in cell elasticity. Direct observation of cells undergoing shear deformation was done by incorporating a small number of AX2 cells expressing the green fluorescent protein of Aequorea victoria and visualizing the strained cell pellet by fluorescence and phase contrast microscopy. These observations confirmed that the shear strain imposed by the rheometer does not injure the cells and that the viscoelastic response of the cell pellet is due to deformation of individual cells.",valid

The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the ""Khon Kaen Community-Based Speech Therapy Model"" in decreasing the number of articulation defects in children with cleft palate and/or lip. Sixteen children with cleft palate and/or lip in 6 districts of Maha Sarakham Province were enrolled for study. A three-day intensive speech camp was held in Srinagarind Hospital and followed by an outreach program of six one-day follow-up speech camps in Maha Sarakham Hospital. Six paraprofessionals, speech assistants, provided home- or community- based speech correction every week for one year. Numbers of various articulation errors were compared pre- and post-treatment using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The number of articulation defects showed a statistically significant reduction (mean difference = 10; Z = -3.52; p < 0.001; 95% CI: 8-13).

27008086,"Amphotericin B (AMB) is a highly hydrophobic antifungal, whose use is limited by its toxicity and poor solubility. To improve its solubility, AMB was reacted with a functionalized polyethylene glycol (PEG), yielding soluble complex AmB-PEG formulations that theoretically comprise of chemically conjugated AMB-PEG and free AMB that is physically associated with the conjugate. Reverse-phase chromatography and size exclusion chromatography methods using HPLC were developed to separate conjugated AMB-PEG and free AmB, enabling the further characterization of these formulations. Using HPLC and dynamic light scattering analyses, it was observed that the AMB-PEG 2 formulation, having a higher molar ratio of 2 AMB: 1 PEG, possesses more free AMB and has relatively larger particle diameters compared to the AMB-PEG 1 formulation, that consists of 1 AMB: 1 PEG. The identity of the conjugate was also verified using mass spectrometry. AMB-PEG 2 demonstrates improved antifungal efficacy relative to AMB-PEG 1, without a concurrent increase in in vitro toxicity to mammalian cells, implying that the additional loading of free AMB in the AMB-PEG formulation can potentially increase its therapeutic index. Compared to unconjugated AMB, AMB-PEG formulations are less toxic to mammalian cells in vitro, even though their MIC50 values are comparatively higher in a variety of fungal strains tested. Our in vitro results suggest that AMB-PEG 2 formulations are two times less toxic than unconjugated AMB with antifungal efficacy on Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans.",valid

29397987,"Colored wheat varieties and crosses were analyzed to figure out their anthocyanin profiles, and thus, their potential as health-related food. After method development, the obtained 94 anthocyanin fingerprints allowed the clear differentiation of the blue aleurone and purple pericarp genotypes as well as their breeding lines. The method was trimmed so that the complete analysis of the whole grain flour including sample preparation of up to 20 samples on one plate took less than 3 h (<9 min per sample) and total costs including sample preparation were <1.0 Euro/sample. Sample preparation of the complex wheat matrix was reduced to a minimum (only acidified methanol extraction of the ground whole wheat grain). Separation was well achieved on amino phases with a mixture of ethyl acetate, 2-butanone, water and formic acid. It was superior to the separation on either normal or reversed phases and more robust with regard to intrinsic pH variances of the sample extracts. Pattern recognition of anthocyanins was simply performed by visual detection (the image), a key feature of high-performance thin-layer chromatography. Wheat varieties and crosses with higher anthocyanin contents were easily selectable, and thus, successfully made out. Prominent anthocyanin zones were characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Their sugar moiety was characterized via methanolysis and compared with the sugars available freely in the whole wheat grain. The developed profiling is a fast and efficient screening tool with option for quantification or identification on the same HPTLC plate.",valid
15664175,"Voltage-gated sodium channels with ""resurgent"" kinetics are specialized for high-frequency firing. The alpha subunits interact with a blocking protein that binds open channels upon depolarization and unbinds upon repolarization, producing resurgent sodium current. By limiting classical inactivation, the cycle of block and unblock shortens refractory periods. To characterize the blocker in Purkinje neurons, we briefly exposed inside-out patches to substrate-specific proteases. Trypsin and chymotrypsin each removed resurgent current, consistent with established roles for positively charged and hydrophobic/aromatic groups in blocking sodium channels. In Purkinje cells, the only known sodium channel-associated subunit that has a cytoplasmic sequence with several positive charges and clustered hydrophobic/aromatic residues is beta4 (KKLITFILKKTREK; beta4(154-167)). After enzymatic removal of block, beta4(154-167) fully reconstituted resurgent current, whereas scrambled or point-mutated peptides were ineffective. In CA3 pyramidal neurons, which lack beta4 and endogenous block, beta4(154-167) generated resurgent current. Thus, beta4 may be the endogenous open-channel blocker responsible for resurgent kinetics.",valid
33050198,"The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGFs) under blue light conditions in an in vivo model of retinal degeneration. Male Wistar rats were exposed to dark/blue light conditions for 9 days. On day 7, right eyes were injected with saline and left eyes with PRGF. Electroretinography (ERG) and intraocular pressure (IoP) measurements were performed before and after the experiment. After sacrifice, retinal samples were collected. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to analyze the structure of retinal sections. Immunofluorescence for brain-specific homeobox/POU domain protein 3A (Brn3a), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), rhodopsin, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was performed to study the retinal conditions. Retinal signaling measured by ERG was reduced by blue light and recovered with PRGF; however, IoP measurements did not show significant differences among treatments. Blue light reduced the expression for Brn3a, ChAT, and rhodopsin. Treatment with PRGF showed a recovery in their expressions. HO-1 and GFAP results showed that blue light increased their expression but the use of PRGF reduced the effect of light. Blue light causes retinal degeneration. PRGF mitigated the injury, restoring the functionality of these cells and maintaining the tissue integrity.",valid

28396581,"BACKGROUND Splenic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is a rare cause of portal hypertension which may manifest with abdominal pain, diarrhea, ascites, and/or hematemesis. Fistula formation may be traumatic or spontaneous. Eighty-six percent of spontaneous splenic AVFs occur in women, and 55% are associated with a preexisting splenic artery aneurysm. CASE REPORT A 64-year-old Caucasian female with unremarkable past medical history presented with new onset of left lower quadrant abdominal pain and persistent diarrhea. CTA demonstrated dilated mesenteric veins consistent with portal hypertension. A 1-cm splenic artery aneurysm associated with a splenic AVF was identified and confirmed by celiac angiography. The splenic artery was embolized both distal and proximal to and within the aneurysm sac. Completion arteriography showed minimal flow throughout the splenic artery, and there was no flow into the splenic AVF. CONCLUSIONS Traditionally, splenectomy has been the definitive treatment, but coil embolization has been recently reported. Successful coil embolization of a splenic AVF is described. Physicians should be aware of this pathology as an etiology of portal hypertension.",valid
16641947,"Neurocognition is moderately to severely impaired in patients with schizophrenia. However, the factor structure of the various neurocognitive deficits, the relationship with symptoms and other variables, and the minimum amount of testing required to determine an adequate composite score has not been determined in typical patients with schizophrenia. An 'all-comer' approach to cognition is needed, as provided by the baseline assessment of an unprecedented number of patients in the CATIE (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness) schizophrenia trial. From academic sites and treatment providers representative of the community, 1493 patients with chronic schizophrenia were entered into the study, including those with medical comorbidity and substance abuse. Eleven neurocognitive tests were administered, resulting in 24 individual scores reduced to nine neurocognitive outcome measures, five domain scores and a composite score. Despite minimal screening procedures, 91.2% of patients provided meaningful neurocognitive data. Exploratory principal components analysis yielded one factor accounting for 45% of the test variance. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that a single-factor model comprised of five domain scores was the best fit. The correlations among the factors were medium to high, and scores on individual factors were very highly correlated with the single composite score. Neurocognitive deficits were modestly correlated with negative symptom severity (r=0.13-0.27), but correlations with positive symptom severity were near zero (r<0.08). Even in an 'all-comer' clinical trial, neurocognitive deficits can be assessed in the overwhelming majority of patients, and the severity of impairment is similar to meta-analytic estimates. Multiple analyses suggested that a broad cognitive deficit characterizes this sample. These deficits are modestly related to negative symptoms and essentially independent of positive symptom severity.",valid

The K562/G01 cell line was infected with AdE-SH2-Caspase 8-HA-GFP adenovirus (SC), then the cells were divided into 3 groups: AdE-SH2m-Caspase 8-HA-GFP (SmC) group, AdE-GFP (CMV) group and PBS group as control. The infection efficiency was observed under fluorescent microscopy and by flow cytometry. The expression of fusion protein SH2-Caspase 8-HA was measured by Western blot. The morphology of the cells detected by Wright's staining. The apoptosis of the cells were detected by flow cytometry and DNA ladder. The expression of Caspase 3 and PARP were detected by Western blot. The infection efficiency of SC on K562/G01 cells was high which was confirmed by fluorescent microscopy and FCM. SH2-Caspase 8-HA fusion protein were expressed correctly in K562/G01 cells. After treatment with SC the apoptosis of K562/G01 cells could be observed by microscopy. The result of FCM showed that early apoptosis of K562/G01 cells increased significantly as compared with control groups (P < 0.05).

2460700,"This study examined the frequently heard claim that aphasic listeners have more difficulty understanding speech in situations where there are multiple speakers than in situations where there is a single speaker. Nine stories about everyday events were written and videotaped as monologues, dialogues with one dominant speaker, and dialogues with both speakers contributing comparable amounts of information. Eighteen aphasic and 9 non-brain-damaged adults watched and listened to the videotapes. Listeners' comprehension and retention of the stories were tested by yes/no questions following each story. The three versions of the stories were understood and remembered equally well by aphasic and non-brain-damaged listeners, suggesting that listening to two speakers does not appreciably increase comprehension difficulty. These results suggest that factors other than the extent to which different speakers contribute to the topic of conversation are responsible for aphasic listeners' reported difficulties in comprehending multiple-speaker conversational interactions.",valid
15043929,"Macromolecular sedimentation in inhomogeneous media is of great practical importance. Dynamic density gradients have a long tradition in analytical ultracentrifugation, and are frequently used in preparative ultracentrifugation.

It is applied to macromolecular sedimentation in the presence of a dynamic density gradient formed by the sedimentation of a co-solute at high concentration. It is implemented in the software SEDFIT for the analysis of experimental macromolecular concentration distributions. The model agrees well with the measured sedimentation profiles of a protein in a dynamic cesium chloride gradient, and may provide a measure for the effects of hydration or preferential solvation parameters. General features of protein sedimentation in dynamic density gradients are described.",valid

We sought to understand how caregivers of children with brain tumors use and are affected by SM. A survey was administered to caregivers of children who were receiving or within the last 5 years received chemotherapy for pediatric brain tumors. Differences in variables across groups were evaluated using nonparametric tests and chi-square tests. Thirty-five of 36 caregivers acknowledged use of SM. Facebook was the most used platform (86%). Fifty-eight percent and 47% used SM to read and share information about their child's cancer, respectively. Thirty-four percent were comforted while 40% were bothered by cancer-related information on SM. Eleven participants (31%) sought a second opinion based on information from SM. Caregivers of children with a poor prognosis were more likely to use a treatment from SM that was not initially recommended by their oncologist (p = 0.043). SM is commonly used by caregivers to obtain and share care-related information. Many noted positive and negative effects of SM on emotional wellness. SM influenced treatment decisions, and this effect was stronger with poorer prognosis.

This study examines adolescents' reported actions to promote or deter friends' smoking, and whether actions vary by adolescents' smoking experience. Data were collected between 2001 and 2004 at four time points across the 9th and 10th grades from an ethnically diverse school-based sample (N = 395; 53% female). Deterrence of smoking was reported by a greater percentage of adolescents than was promotion of smoking, both among those who had ever smoked and never smoked. By the end of the study, over 45% of ever smokers and less than 5% of never smokers had promoted smoking among friends. In contrast, over 70% of ever smokers and roughly 40% of never smokers had deterred smoking. Among adolescents who had ever smoked, positive consequences of smoking by fall of 10th grade predicted attempts to promote smoking by the end of 10th grade (OR = 4.37, p < .05). To a lesser extent, negative consequences of smoking predicted attempts to deter smoking (OR = 2.60, p < .08). These effects were independent of the opposite type of smoking consequences, level of personal smoking experience, having close friends who smoked, prior attempts to influence friends' behavior, and smoker's gender.

37490948,"Postural sway and physical capacity had not previously been compared between people with long COVID and people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Therefore, this study determined postural sway and physical capacity in people with long COVID (∼16-month illness duration; n = 21) and ME/CFS (∼16-year illness duration; n = 20), vs age-matched healthy controls (n = 20). Postural sway was during a 30-s static stand test. Physical capacity was determined using the Timed Up and Go test and 5 Times Sit to Stand test. Throughout, participants wore isoinertial measurement units. Postural sway was worse (ie, greater) in people with long COVID and ME/CFS than controls, but not different between long COVID and ME/CFS. Performance of the Timed Up and Go test and 5 Times Sit to Stand test were worse in long COVID and ME/CFS than controls, but not different between long COVID and ME/CFS. Of long COVID and ME/CFS participants, 87% and 13% exceeded the threshold for muscle weakness in the 5 Times Sit to Stand test and Timed Up and Go test, respectively. These data suggest that both people with long COVID and people with ME/CFS have similarly impaired balance and physical capacity. Therefore, there is an urgent need for interventions to target postural sway and physical capacity in people with ME/CFS, and given the current pandemic, people with long COVID.",valid
37352204,"Soybean is a major source of seed protein and oil globally with an average composition of 40% protein and 20% oil in the seed. The goal of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring seed protein and oil content utilizing a population constructed by crossing an above average protein content line, PI 399084 to another line that had a low protein content value, PI 507429, both from the USDA soybean germplasm collection. The recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, PI 507429 x PI 399084, was evaluated in two replications over four years (2018-2021); the seeds were analyzed for seed protein and oil content using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy. The recombinant inbred lines and the two parents were re-sequenced using genotyping by sequencing. A total of 12,761 molecular markers, which came from genotyping by sequencing, the SoySNP6k BeadChip and selected simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from known protein QTL chromosomal regions were used for mapping. One QTL was identified on chromosome 2 explaining up to 56.8% of the variation for seed protein content and up to 43% for seed oil content. Another QTL identified on chromosome 15 explained up to 27.2% of the variation for seed protein and up to 41% of the variation for seed oil content. The protein and oil QTLs of this study and their associated molecular markers will be useful in breeding to improve nutritional quality in soybean.",valid

27755771,"An analysis of the factors controlling rates of nitrogen cycling in northern temperate forest ecosystems is presented based on a quantitative analysis of an extensive data set for forests in Wisconsin and Massachusetts as those data are synthesized in a computer model (VEGIE) of organic matter and nutrient dynamics. The model is of the ""lumped-parameter,"" nutrient-flux-density type, dealing with major components of forest ecosystems rather than stems or species. It deals explicitly with the interactions among light, water, and nutrient availability in determining transient and equilibrium rates of primary production and nutrient cycling. Data are presented for parameterizing the plant component of the system at either the species or community level. A major conclusion is that the ultimate control on equilibrium nitrogen-cycling rates resides not within the nitrogen cycle itself (for example in litter quality or net primary production [NPP] allocation patterns) but rather in ratios of resource-use efficiency by vegetation as compared with the ratios of resource availability. Litter quality and allocation patterns, along with rates of N deposition, do affect the rate at which a system approaches the equilibrium cycling rate. The model is used to explain observed variation in nitrogen-cycling rates among forest types, and to predict the timing and occurrence of ""nitrogen saturation"" (N availability in excess of biotic demand) as a function of nitrogen deposition rates and harvesting.",valid

Reports indicate CSH decreases pituitary oxytocin (OT) without affecting pituitary vasopressin (VP). However, preliminary studies from our laboratory strongly indicate that CSH has an effect on VP release. Experiments were conducted with dibenzyline-treated, urethane-anesthetized, male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Rats were injected with 4 mU of standard VP and 4 mg/100 g of CSH. Administration of VP resulted in an increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 23.5 +/- 3.2 mm Hg. Administration of CSH resulted in a consistent, immediate decrease in MAP of 13.0 +/- 2.0 mm Hg prior to an increase of 21.0 +/- 2.6 mm Hg. The effects due to VP and CSH were strikingly different; the CSH-induced MAP rise took longer to peak and to return to baseline. Both the VP- and CSH-induced MAP rise were markedly inhibited by a prior administration of a specific VP antagonist d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)]AVP. In addition, the typical increase in MAP observed in SD rats following CSH administration was substantially reduced when the same dose was administered in homozygous diabetes insipidus (HODI) rats. The data presented here strongly suggest that CSH-induced MAP elevation is due to the release of VP from the pituitary gland.",valid

Survey questions addressed the nature of their activities, their financial relationships with industry, and the perceived effectiveness of their conflict of interest policies. Amount and sources of revenue as well as organizational experiences with and policies regarding financial conflict of interest. Of the 439 surveys mailed to PAO leaders, 289 (65.8%) were returned with at least 80% of the questions answered. The PAOs varied widely in terms of size, funding, activities, and disease focus. The median total revenue among responding organizations was $299 140 (interquartile range, $70 000-$1 200 000). A total of 165 of 245 PAOs (67.3%) reported receiving industry funding, with 19 of 160 PAOs (11.9%) receiving more than half of their funding from industry. Among the subset of PAOs that received industry funding, the median amount was $50 000 (interquartile range, $15 000-$200 000); the median proportion of industry support derived from the pharmaceutical, device, and/or biotechnology sectors was 45% (interquartile range, 0%-100%).

The aim of this work was to determine if changes in apple physiology caused by the proliferation of fungal decay organisms would foster the survival of E. coli O157:H7. Trials were performed where (A) plant pathogens (4 log10 spores) were added to apple wounds 4 days before the wounds were inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 (3 log10 CFU g(-1) apple) (both RT and 4 degrees C storage), (B) plant pathogens and E. coli O157:H7 were added on the same day (both RT and 4 degrees C storage), and (C) E. coli O157:H7 was added 2 days (RT storage) and 4 days (4 degrees C storage) before plant pathogens. In all trials E. coli O157:H7 levels generally declined to <1 log10 at 4 degrees C storage, and in the presence of P. expansum at 4 degrees C or RT. However, in the presence of G. cingulata at RT E. coli O157:H7 numbers increased from 3.18 to 4.03 log10 CFU g(-1) in the apple wound during trial A, from 3.26 to 6.31 log10 CFU g(-1) during trial B, and from 3.22 to 6.81 log10 CFU g(-1) during trial C. This effect is probably a consequence of the attendant rise in pH from 4.1 to approximately 6.8, observed with the proliferation of G. cingulata rot. Control apples (inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 only) were contaminated with opportunistic decay organisms at RT during trials A and B, leading to E. coli O157:H7 death. However, E. coli O157:H7 in control apples in trial C, where no contamination occurred, increased from 3.22 to 5.97 log10 CFU g(-1).

To study the effect of IF alongside CR, we imposed IF in FVB/N mice or IF combined with CR using the transgenic FVB/N alphaMUPA mice that, when fed ad libitum, exhibit spontaneously reduced eating and extended life span. Our results show that when food was introduced during the light period, body temperature peak was not disrupted. In contrast, IF caused almost arrhythmicity in clock gene expression in the liver and advanced mPer2 and mClock expression. However, IF restored the amplitudes of clock gene expression under disruptive light condition regardless whether the animals were calorically restricted or not. Unlike daytime feeding, nighttime feeding yielded rhythms similar to those generated during ad libitum feeding. Taken together, our results show that IF can affect circadian rhythms differently depending on the timing of food availability, and suggest that this regimen induces a metabolic state that affects the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) clock.",valid

Divided into subclasses based on sequence characteristics and substrate specificity, these integral membrane transporters play key roles in metal homeostasis, metal tolerance, and the biosynthesis of metalloproteins. The P(1B-4)-ATPases have the simplest architecture of the five P(1B)-ATPase families and have been suggested to play a role in Co(2+) transport. A P(1B-4)-ATPase from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS-14.1, designated sCoaT, has been cloned, expressed, and purified. Activity assays indicate that sCoaT is specific for Co(2+). A single Co(2+) binding site is present, and optical, electron paramagnetic resonance, and X-ray absorption spectroscopic data are consistent with tetrahedral coordination by oxygen and nitrogen ligands, including a histidine and likely a water. Surprisingly, there is no evidence for coordination by sulfur. Mutation of a conserved cysteine residue, Cys 327, in the signature transmembrane Ser-Pro-Cys metal binding motif does not abolish the ATP hydrolysis activity or affect the spectroscopic analysis, establishing that this residue is not involved in the initial Co(2+) binding by sCoaT. In contrast, replacements of conserved transmembrane residues Ser 325, His 657, Glu 658, and Thr 661 with alanine abolish ATP hydrolysis activity and Co(2+) binding, indicating that these residues are necessary for Co(2+) transport.

BMVECs co-cultured with astrocytes were stimulated with or without thrombase and then transfected with miR-18a mimic and/or si-RUNX1. The trans-endothelial electric resistance (TEER) and FlNa flux were measured, respectively. The potential interaction between RUNX1 and miR-18a was also detected. Additionally, SD rats were injected with fresh autologous non-anticoagulant blood into the brain basal ganglia to establish ICH model. After administration with miR-18a, sh-miR-18a, miR-18a+RUNX1, sh-miR-18a+sh-RUNX1, respectively, BBB permeability was assessed. After overexpressing miR-18a, the expression levels of RUNX1, Occludin and ZO-1 were decreased, but the Evan's blue contents and brain water contents were significantly increased in ICH rats. Additionally, rat neurological function was impaired, accompanying with an increase of TEER and fluorescein sodium flux. MiR-18a was a direct target of RUNX1 and it could bind to the promoters of RUNX1 to inhibit the expression of Occuldin and ZO-1. Consistently, these phenomena could also be observed in the corresponding cell model. Conversely, miR-18a knockdown or RUNX1 overexpression just presented an improvement effect on ICH. MiR-18a plays a critical role during ICH because it targets to RUNX1 to inhibit the expression of tight junction proteins (Occludin and ZO-1) and then disrupt BBB permeability. MiR-18a might be a probable therapeutic target for ICH diseases.",valid

We have identified 1028 homo-logous superfamilies in which the proteins have both structural, and sequence or functional similarity. These can be further clustered into 672 fold groups and 35 distinct architectures. Recent developments of the database include the generation of 3D templates for recognising structural relatives in each fold group, which has led to significant improvements in the speed and accuracy of updating the database and also means that less manual validation is required. We also report the establishment of the CATH-PFDB (Protein Family Database), which associates 1D sequences with the 3D homologous superfamilies. Sequences showing identifiable homology to entries in CATH have been extracted from GenBank using PSI-BLAST. A CATH-PSIBLAST server has been established, which allows you to scan a new sequence against the database. The CATH Dictionary of Homologous Superfamilies (DHS), which contains validated multiple structural alignments annotated with consensus functional information for evolutionary protein superfamilies, has been updated to include annotations associated with sequence relatives identified in GenBank.

This was a retrospective study of AMR using Becton, Dickinson and Company Insights Research Database (Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, US) data collected 2011-2019. Thirty-day, nonduplicate Escherichia coli urine isolates from US female outpatients (aged ≥12 years) were included. Isolates were evaluated for nonsusceptibility (intermediate/resistant) to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, or nitrofurantoin, and assessed for extended-spectrum β-lactamase production (ESBL+) and for ≥2 or ≥3 drug-resistance phenotypes. Generalized estimating equations were used to model AMR trends over time and by US census region. Among 1 513 882 E. coli isolates, the overall prevalence of isolates nonsusceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, and nitrofurantoin was 25.4%, 21.1%, and 3.8%, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of this simplified gingivoperiosteoplasty technique at the age of permanent canine eruption. Forty nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate patients who had undergone simplified gingivoperiosteoplasty were retrospectively reviewed. Canine eruption and the bone formation rate of the interalveolar septum using the Bergland method and a modified Long et al. method were evaluated. A total of 55 alveolar cleft sites were treated. Simplified gingivoperiosteoplasty was performed at a mean age of 13.4 months, and the mean age at the time of follow-up was 14.3 years. The overall success rate of simplified gingivoperiosteoplasty was 50.90%. With regard to cleft types, clefts of the primary palate and unilateral alveolar clefts showed a significantly higher success rate than clefts of the primary and secondary palates and bilateral alveolar clefts, respectively. Our gingivoperiosteoplasty technique is a simple surgical procedure and is performed at 12 months of age, at which time the cleft alveolus has grown sufficiently, to ensure the success of the delicate surgical technique.

9353857,"The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic relevance of relatives' interactive behaviour towards the patient, as covered by the Münster Family Interview (MFI), to the further course of the schizophrenic illness. The MFI is a family interview (of the whole family, including the patient) designed to record the emotional family atmosphere based on the concept of expressed emotion (EE). The ratings take place directly after the interview on five scales (criticism, hostility, overinvolvement, resignation and warmth), the resignation scale being added to the 'classic' EE scales. Ninety-nine families of outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to the DSM-III were examined with the MFI during a home visit. The patients were seen 1 and 2 years after the first examination. The target criteria selected for the prognostic significance of the interaction measurements were: rehospitalisation within 2 years; extent of symptoms after 1 year, and psychosocial skills after 1 year. The significance of the interaction dimensions was verified in regression models. The control variable used in the regression models was the Strauss-Carpenter scale. Regression models were produced for the total group and for a subgroup of moderately ill patients. All target criteria yielded serviceable prediction models. The most important variable for prediction was the control variable, the Strauss-Carpenter scale. However the interaction variables made additional contributions to the prognosis, especially in the subgroup of moderately ill patients. The best MFI scale for all the outcome criteria was resignation; criticism predicted only the symptomatology, and emotional overinvolvement the level of social functioning after 1 year. In conclusion, practical work with families of schizophrenic patients should emphasise the protective function of relatives towards patients more strongly.",valid

23549407,"There is a high incidence of metabolic syndrome among patients with primary aldosteronism (PA), which has recently been associated with an unfavorable cardiometabolic profile. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been clarified in detail. Characterizing aldosterone (Ald) target genes in adipocytes will help us to elucidate the deleterious effects associated with excess Ald. Apelin, a novel adipokine, exerts beneficial effects on obesity-associated disorders and cardiovascular homeostasis. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of high Ald levels on apelin expression and secretion and the underlying mechanisms involved in adipocytes. In vivo, a single-dose Ald injection acutely decreased apelin serum levels and adipose tissue apelin production, which demonstrates a clear inverse relationship between the levels of plasma Ald and plasma apelin. Experiments using 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed that Ald decreased apelin expression and secretion in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This effect was reversed by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists or GR (NR3C1) knockdown; furthermore, putative HREs were identified in the apelin promoter. Subsequently, we verified that both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids regulated apelin expression through GR activation, although no synergistic effect was observed.

OLETF rats with IGT were mild obese, with fat infiltration in the islets and skeletal muscles. Their blood Cho and TG were higher than those of LETO rats (2.5 mmol/L +/- 0.3 mmol/L vs 2.1 mmol/L +/- 0.3 mmol/L, P < 0.01; 0.7 mmol/L +/- 0.2 mmol/L vs 0.4 +/- 0.2 mmol/L, P < 0.01), but their TG was lower than that of diabetic rats (1.8 +/- 1.0). The Cho, TG and post-challenge glucose levels were normal in the IGT rats with 4-week acarbose treatment, with their insulin secretion and glucose tolerance improved and fat infiltration decreased. Acarbose can prevent obesity and fat infiltration in islets and muscles, improve glucose and lipid metabolism, and insulin secretion in OLETF rats with IGT.",valid
38124204,"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is poorly treated due to the presence of an inhibitory immune microenvironment. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are an important component of TME. ALOX5 is an important lipid metabolism enzyme in cancer progression, but the mechanism by which it regulates TAM to promote ICC progression is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential mechanism of TAM regulation by ALOX5 and the translational effect of targeting ALOX5. In this study, we investigated the association between the spatial localization of epithelial cells and TAMs by combining scRNA-seq analysis with multiplex immunofluorescence analysis. Through bulk sequencing analysis and spatial analysis, lipid metabolism genes closely related to TAM infiltration were screened. In vitro co-culture model was constructed to verify that ALOX5 and its downstream metabolite LTB4 promote M2 macrophage migration. Bulk sequencing after co-culture combined with single-cell analysis was performed to identify key pathways for up-regulation of M2 macrophage migration. Finally, the effect of CSF1R inhibitor (PLX3397) combined with ALOX5 inhibitor (Zileuton) in vivo was investigated by by xenograft tumor formation experiment in nude mice. ALOX5 in ICC cells was a key lipid metabolism gene affecting the infiltration of M2 macrophages in TME. Mechanically, LTB4, a metabolite downstream of ALOX5, recruited M2 macrophages to migrate around tumor cells by binding to BLT1/BLT2 and activating the PI3K pathway, which ultimately lead to the promotion of ICC progression. Targeting CSF1R in combination with ALOX5 inhibitor effectively reduced tumor volume and M2 macrophage infiltration abundance. In ICC, LTB4, a metabolite secreted by ALOX5 of epithelial cells, binded to BLT1/BLT2 on TAM surface to activate PI3K pathway and promote TAM migration, thus promoting ICC progression. Targeting CSF1R in combination with ALOX5 inhibitor for ICC is a promising combination therapy modality.",valid
23114860,"The immunological synapse (IS) regulates immune responses by integrating extracellular stimuli into intracellular signalling networks, which causes leukocyte differentiation and effector functions. The dynamic spatial organisation of molecules at the IS was initially characterised by wide-field fluorescence microscopy of cell conjugates and cells interacting with planar lipid bilayers. These methods showed stable supramolecular clusters of several microns in size, which were proposed to be responsible for sustained signalling and cell-cell adhesion. The recent emergence of microspectroscopy techniques with higher spatial and temporal resolution nonetheless reveals the complex dynamics of molecular reactions that mediate IS assembly and function. This review describes microspectroscopy-based in vitro experimental approaches for imaging the molecular dynamics at the IS, as well as their contributions and open questions in the field. It also describes experimental methods to obtain quantitative parameters of dynamic biochemical reactions in living cells, and discusses about the important role of quantitative imaging and theoretical science in our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying lymphocyte activation.",valid

To explore the compliance, acceptability and treatment satisfaction using group BBAT in traumatised refugees. To study changes in psychiatric and somatic symptoms as well as quality of life, level of functioning and quality of movement during treatment with BBAT. All Arabic speaking patients that previously had received treatment at the Competence Centre for Transcultural Psychiatry in Copenhagen from April 2008 to June 2009 were invited to participate (N=29). Nine persons were included in a male (N=4) and female (N=5) group. All participants were traumatised refugees. The BBAT treatment consisted of 14 sessions over a period of 14 weeks. Before and after treatment the participants were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. The interviews were transcribed and analysed with a thematic approach. The participants also filled out self-administrated questionnaires and two physiotherapists tested the participants' movement harmony using the Body Awareness Rating Scale-Movement Harmony (BARS-MH) test. At the end of the study, the participants filled out anonymous questionnaires about treatment satisfaction. The results showed that the participants had a high compliance, acceptability and treatment satisfaction with BBAT. The majority of participants showed improvements in symptoms from baseline to post-intervention on the self-administrated questionnaires and in the BARS-MH test. Further research is needed to expand the scientific knowledge regarding the use of BBAT in traumatised refugees.

3367658,"A simple slice chamber was designed to achieve easy manipulations of temperature, ionic composition and drug concentrations. Spontaneous and evoked extracellular potentials could be recorded with glass microelectrodes from 500 micron thick slices of rat frontal neocortex. In the absence of magnesium ions in the superfusing medium or in the presence of convulsant agents, epileptiform activity was seen. The amplitude of this activity was greatest in layer II/III, each burst consisting of a long-lasting negative potential on the decay phase of which were superimposed many afterpotentials. There were multiple foci from which spontaneous epileptiform bursts spread to other ipsi- and contralateral parts of the cortex via both the grey and white matter. Although such bursts were observed between 23 and 37 degrees C, optimal recording of discrete epileptiform activity was achieved at 29 +/- 1 degrees C. Decreasing extracellular calcium or increasing extracellular concentrations of potassium enhanced burst discharges. Proconvulsant agents initiated both interictal and ictal epileptiform events. This, together with the reduction of epileptiform activity by standard anticonvulsant drugs such as carbamazepine and phenobarbitone suggested that this in vitro model may be useful for studying the pharmacology of epileptogenesis and for developing new therapeutic strategies for epilepsy.",valid
16133256,"Micropropagated rose plants (Rosa hybrida L., cv. New Dawn) were inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices (Schenk and Smith) and subjected to different drought regimens. The dual objectives of these experiments were to investigate the mechanism and the extent to which AM can prevent drought damages and whether physiological analyses reveal enhanced drought tolerance of an economically important plant such as the rose. In a long-term drought experiment with four different water regimens, visual scoring of wilt symptoms affirmed that AM in a selected host-symbiont combination increased plant performance. This effect was mostly expressed if moderate drought stress was constantly applied over a long period. In a short-term experiment in which severe drought stress was implemented and plants were allowed to recover after 4 or 9 days, no visual differences between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roses were observed. Therefore, the early physiological steps conferring drought tolerance were prone to investigation. Proline content in leaves proved to be an unsuitable marker for AM-induced drought tolerance, whereas analysis of chlorophyll a fluorescence using the JIP test (collecting stress-induced changes of the polyphasic O-J-I-P fluorescence kinetics in a non-destructive tissue screening) was more explanatory. Parameters derived from this test could describe the extent of foliar stress response and help to differentiate physiological mechanisms of stress tolerance. AM led to a more intense electron flow and a higher productive photosynthetic activity at several sites of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. A K step, known as a stress indicator of general character, appeared in the fluorescence transient only in drought-stressed non-mycorrhizal plants; conversely, the data elucidate a stabilising effect of AM on the oxygen-evolving complex at the donor site of photosystem (PS) II and at the electron-transport chain between PS II and PS I. If drought stress intensity was reduced by a prolonged and milder drying phase, these significant tolerance features were less pronounced or missing, indicating a possible threshold level for mycorrhizal tolerance induction.",valid

This study aims to examine the relationship between amplitude and stability of circadian rhythm with sleep quality and sleepiness. In this cross-sectional research, 315 shift nurses and health care workers from educational hospitals of Kerman University of Medical Sciences (KUMS), Iran, were selected using a random sampling method. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Circadian Type Inventory (CTI) were used to collect the required data. In this study, 83.2% suffered from poor sleep and one-half had moderate and excessive sleepiness. The results showed that flexibility in circadian rhythm stability, job stress and sleepiness are among the factors affecting quality sleep in shift workers. Those whose circadian rhythm amplitude was languid suffered more from sleepiness and those whose circadian stability was flexible had a better sleep. Variables including circadian rhythm stability (flexible/rigid) and amplitude (languid/vigorous) can act as predictive indices in order to employ people in a shift work system so that sleepiness and a drop in quality of sleep are prevented.",valid
30574116,"The perception of gaze direction involves the integration of a number of sensory cues exterior to the eye-region. The orientation of the head is one such cue, which has an overall repulsive effect on the perceived direction of gaze. However, in a recent experiment, we found the measured effect of head orientation on perceived gaze direction differed within subjects, depending on whether a single- or two-interval task design was employed. This suggests a potential difference in the way the orientation of the head is integrated into the perception of gaze direction across tasks. Four experiments were conducted to investigate this difference. The first two experiments showed that the difference was not the result of some interaction between stimuli in the two-interval task, but rather, a difference between the types of judgment being made across tasks, where observers were making a directional (left/right) judgment in the single-interval task, and a non-directional (direct/indirect gaze) judgment in the two-interval task. A third experiment showed that this difference does not arise from observers utilizing a non-directional cue to direct gaze (the circularity of the pupil/iris) in making their non-directional judgments. The fourth experiment showed no substantial differences in the duration of evidence accumulation and processing between judgments, suggesting that observers are not integrating different sensory information across tasks. Together these experiments show that the sensory information from head orientation is flexibly weighted in the perception of gaze direction, and that the purpose of the observer, in sampling gaze information, can influence the consequent perception of gaze direction.",valid

18690111,"Antidepressant drugs produce therapeutic actions and many of their side effects via blockade of the plasma membrane transporters for serotonin (SERT/SLC6A2), norepinephrine (NET/SLC6A1), and dopamine (DAT/SLC6A3). Many antidepressants block several of these transporters; some are more selective. Mouse gene knockouts of these transporters provide interesting models for possible effects of chronic antidepressant treatments. To examine the role of monoamine transporters in models of depression DAT, NET, and SERT knockout (KO) mice and wild-type littermates were studied in the forced swim test (FST), the tail suspension test, and for sucrose consumption. To dissociate general activity from potential antidepressant effects three types of behavior were assessed in the FST: immobility, climbing, and swimming. In confirmation of earlier reports, both DAT KO and NET KO mice exhibited less immobility than wild-type littermates whereas SERT KO mice did not. Effects of DAT deletion were not simply because of hyperactivity, as decreased immobility was observed in DAT+/- mice that were not hyperactive as well as in DAT-/- mice that displayed profound hyperactivity. Climbing was increased, whereas swimming was almost eliminated in DAT-/- mice, and a modest but similar effect was seen in NET KO mice, which showed a modest decrease in locomotor activity. Combined increases in climbing and decreases in immobility are characteristic of FST results in antidepressant animal models, whereas selective effects on swimming are associated with the effects of stimulant drugs. Therefore, an effect on climbing is thought to more specifically reflect antidepressant effects, as has been observed in several other proposed animal models of reduced depressive phenotypes. A similar profile was observed in the tail suspension test, where DAT, NET, and SERT knockouts were all found to reduce immobility, but much greater effects were observed in DAT KO mice. However, to further determine whether these effects of DAT KO in animal models of depression may be because of the confounding effects of hyperactivity, mice were also assessed in a sucrose consumption test. Sucrose consumption was increased in DAT KO mice consistent with reduced anhedonia, and inconsistent with competitive hyperactivity; no increases were observed in SERT KO or NET KO mice. In summary, the effects of DAT KO in animal models of depression are larger than those produced by NET or SERT KO, and unlikely to be simply the result of the confounding effects of locomotor hyperactivity; thus, these data support reevaluation of the role that DAT expression could play in depression and the potential antidepressant effects of DAT blockade.",valid
37170562,"The estimation of biological sex is a critical step in the assessment of the biological profile of an anonymous skeletonized individual. In certain recovery circumstances, the most dimorphic skeletal areas, such as the pelvis, are absent or fragmented; in that case, other bones of the skeleton, including the clavicle and scapula, can be used to predict sex. The purpose of this research is to generate new models for the estimation of sex with clavicular and scapular measurements using a study-sample of 129 individuals with clavicle (65 males and 64 females) and 112 individuals with scapula (50 males and 62 females) from the Lisbon Identified Skeletal Collection (Portugal). A decision tree classifier (C4.5) and logistic regression (LR) were employed to create univariable and multivariable sex prediction models. Accuracy under cross-validation of the classification models is high (up to 93.8%), with minimal bias (<5%), particularly in the multivariable models. The proposed LR models facilitate the probabilistic estimation of biological sex, accounting for the significant overlap in the expression of sexual dimorphism.",valid

Adolescents completed an anonymous online survey on their smoking behaviors, perceptions of parenting behaviors, and smoking-related cognitions including attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. Parents completed a paper-and-pencil questionnaire on their parenting behaviors. Results indicated that psychological control and frequency of communication about smoking were positively linked to adolescent smoking through the mediation of two smoking-related cognitions-attitude and subjective norm. Parental knowledge of adolescent activities, disapproval of adolescent smoking, and home rules were negatively linked to adolescent smoking through the mediation of attitude and subjective norm. Results suggest that parenting practices and smoking-related cognitions are critical components to be incorporated in prevention and intervention programs for adolescent smoking in China.",valid
18852102,"Phylogenetic analysis depends on inferential methodology estimating accurately the degree of divergence between sequences. Inaccurate estimates can lead to misleading evolutionary inferences, including incorrect tree topology estimates and poor dating of historical species divergence. Protein coding sequences are ubiquitous in phylogenetic inference, but many of the standard methods commonly used to describe their evolution do not explicitly account for the dependencies between sites in a codon induced by the genetic code. This study evaluates the performance of several standard methods on datasets simulated under a simple substitution model, describing codon evolution under a range of different types of selective pressures. This approach also offers insights into the relative performance of different phylogenetic methods when there are dependencies acting between the sites in the data. Methods based on statistical models performed well when there was no or limited purifying selection in the simulated sequences (low degree of dependency between sites in a codon), although more biologically realistic models tended to outperform simpler models. Phylogenetic methods exhibited greater variability in performance for sequences simulated under strong purifying selection (high degree of the dependencies between sites in a codon). Simple models substantially underestimate the degree of divergence between sequences, and underestimation was more pronounced on the internal branches of the tree. This underestimation resulted in some statistical methods performing poorly and exhibiting evidence for systematic bias in tree inference. Amino acid-based and nucleotide models that contained generic descriptions of spatial and temporal heterogeneity, such as mixture and temporal hidden Markov models, coped notably better, producing more accurate estimates of evolutionary divergence and the tree topology.",valid
2118505,"Secondary site mutations that restore sporulation to sporulation-defective spo0F or spo0B deletion mutants were found to reside in the spo0A gene. Sequence analysis of 23 such sof mutants showed that the sof mutations fell into six classes of missense codon changes, primarily in the conserved amino-terminal domain of the response regulator Spo0A protein. Changes were observed in codons 12, 14, 60, 92, and 121. The residues affected were predominantly located in the potential turn regions at one end of the amino-terminal conserved domain on the same topological face as the active site aspartate residues. The ability of sof mutations to suppress deficiencies in the transmitter kinases, KinA and KinB, of two-component regulatory systems was tested. All of the sof mutations suppressed the sporulation deficiency of kinA mutants but only two classes among five tested suppressed kinB mutations. sof mutants segregated Spo- colonies at high frequency. Five of these Spo- mutants were found to result from mutations in the spo0A locus that reversed the effect of the sof mutatation. One of these was sequenced and found to have the original sof mutation and a new mutation, sos, at codon 105. The accumulation of sos mutations in sof strains suggested that the sof mutations have a subtle, yet deleterious, effect on the growth of the cell. The results suggested that the sof mutations increase the avidity for or reactivity with transmitter kinases in an allele-specific manner, although in some cases it is possible that the sof mutations obviate the need for phosphorylation to activate the Spo0A protein. An alternative hypothesis is presented in which the sof mutations play the role of bypass mutations for kinases.",valid
19422607,"While many genetic alterations have been identified in melanoma, the relevant molecular events that contribute to disease progression are poorly understood. Most primary human melanomas exhibit loss of expression of the CDKN2A locus in addition to activation of the canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. In this study, we used a Cdkn2a-deficient mouse melanocyte cell line to screen for secondary genetic events in melanoma tumor progression. Upon investigation, intrachromosomal gene amplification of Met, a receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in melanoma progression, was identified in Cdkn2a-deficient tumors. RNA interference targeting Met in these tumor cells resulted in a significant delay in tumor growth in vivo compared with the control cells. MET expression is rarely detected in primary human melanoma but is frequently observed in metastatic disease.

27059462,"Liver cancer, of which hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is by far the most common type, is the second most deadly cancer (746,000 deaths in 2012). Currently, the only curative treatment for HCC is surgery to remove the malignancy (resection) or to remove the entire diseased liver followed by transplantation of healthy liver tissue. Given the shortage of healthy livers, it is crucial to provide transplants to patients that have the best chance of long-term survival. Currently, transplantation is determined via the Milan criteria-patients within Milan (single tumor < 5 cm or 2-3 tumors < 3 cm with no extrahepatic spread nor intrahepatic vascular invasion) are typically eligible for transplantation. However, combining microRNA expression profiling with the Milan criteria can improve prediction of recurrence. HCC often presents with multiple distinct tumor foci arising from local spread of a primary tumor or from the oncogenic predisposition of the diseased liver. Substantial genomic heterogeneity between tumor foci within a single patient has been reported; therefore, biomarker development must account for the possibility of highly heterogeneous genomic profiles from the same individual. MicroRNA profiling was performed on 180 HCC tumor samples from 89 patients who underwent liver transplantation at the University of Rochester Medical Center. The primary outcome was recurrence-free survival time, and patients were observed for 3 years post-transplantation. MicroRNA expression profiles were used to develop a biomarker that distinguishes HCC patients at greater risk of recurrence post-transplantation. Unsupervised clustering uncovered two distinct subgroups with vast differences in standard transplantation selection criteria and recurrence-free survival times. These subgroups were subsequently used to identify microRNAs strongly associated with HCC recurrence. Our results show that reduced expression of five specific microRNAs is significantly associated with HCC recurrence post-transplantation. MicroRNA profiling of distinct tumor foci, coupled with methods that address within-subject tumor heterogeneity, has the potential to significantly improve prediction of HCC recurrence post-transplantation. The development of a clinically applicable HCC biomarker would inform treatment options for patients and contribute to liver transplant selection criteria for practitioners.",valid

20371483,"Although it is known that most HIV-1 infections worldwide result from exposure to virus in semen, it has not yet been established whether transmitted strains originate as RNA virions in seminal plasma or as integrated proviral DNA in infected seminal leukocytes. We present phylogenetic evidence that among six transmitting pairs of men who have sex with men, blood plasma virus in the recipient is consistently more closely related to the seminal plasma virus in the source. All sequences were subtype B, and the env C2V3 of transmitted variants tended to have higher mean isoelectric points, contain potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and favor CCR5 co-receptor usage. A statistically robust phylogenetically corrected analysis did not detect genetic signatures reliably associated with transmission, but further investigation of larger samples of transmitting pairs holds promise for determining which structural and genetic features of viral genomes are associated with transmission.",valid
2920902,"The effect of cyanoketone (inhibitor of delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) and epostane (inhibitor of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) on LH-induced in vitro germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) in the oocytes of Indian major carps, Labeo rohita, Cirrhinus mrigala, and Catla catla, was investigated using five concentrations for each inhibitor. Both of these inhibitors could significantly inhibit the LH-induced GVBD at all of their concentrations in L. rohita and C. catla. However, in C. mrigala, when the oocytes were incubated with cyanoketone or epostane along with LH, the rate of GVBD was not induced significantly at their lowest concentration but four other higher concentrations could inhibit the LH-induced GVBD. A probable mechanism of inhibition of the oocyte maturation by these inhibitors is discussed in the light of available literature.",valid
36053310,"Stagnation of skull growth is correlated with papilledema in craniosynostosis. In this retrospective cohort study, we describe the postoperative skull growth after surgical correction for sagittal synostosis and its relation to the development of papilledema. Patients with isolated sagittal synostosis at our center between 2005 and 2012 were included. Occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) was analyzed, at 3 time points (preoperative, 2 years postoperative, and last OFC measurement) and 3 phases (initial postoperative growth, long-term growth, and overall growth), and related to papilledema on fundoscopy. In total, 163 patients were included. The first time interval showed a decline in skull growth, with subsequent stabilization at long term. Papilledema occurred postoperatively in 10 patients. In these patients, the OFC at 2 years and at last follow-up (T3) were significantly smaller than in patients without papilledema. A larger OFC resulted in a decreased odds of developing papilledema at both postoperative time points (at T2 (OR = 0.40, p = 0.01) and at T3 (OR 0.29, p < 0.001)). Sensitivity and specificity analysis indicated that an OFC below 0.25 SD at T2 (sensitivity 90%, specificity 65%) and below 0.49 at T3 (sensitivity 100%, specificity 60%) are related to the occurrence of papilledema. A small OFC is correlated with the occurrence of papilledema. A decline in OFC within 2 years postoperatively is common in sagittal synostosis and is acceptable up to a value of 0.25SD. Patients with an OFC at last follow-up of less than 0.5SD are at risk for developing papilledema.",valid

Accuracy was greater for immediate than delayed pointing and there was an effect of delay for the orientation of the main axis of the pointing distribution in both groups, indicating distinct spatial representations with development such as ego- and allocentric frames of reference, respectively. The pointing responses of the blind covered less surface area indicating better overall accuracy as compared to the sighted blindfolded. The hands differed for four of the six precision and accuracy parameters. The right hand performed better and seemed relatively contextually oriented, whereas the responses of the left hand were closer to the body and egocentrically oriented. The elongation of the scatter of the pointing responses was greater for the boys and more allocentrically oriented, indicating gender differences in spatial representation. The study provides a first evidence of ego- and allocentric spatial frames of reference in congenitally blind children and an ability to point at targets with the left and right hands in the total absence of vision.",valid

We hypothesized this protocol to result in clinically acceptable radiation toxicities. Dogs diagnosed with and irradiated for anal sac adenocarcinoma (ASAC) were retrospectively assessed. Eleven dogs were included, six had prior surgery. Before any therapy, staging according to Polton et al. resulted in the following distribution: stage 1 (n = 1), stage 2 (n = 1), stage 3a (n = 6), stage 3b (n = 3). We scored radiation toxicities at the end of therapy, at weeks 1, 3 and every 3 months after RT according to Veterinary Radiation Therapy Oncology Group radiation toxicity criteria. Clinical follow-up was maintained on regular intervals combined with computed tomography (n = 3). Median follow-up time for dogs still alive was 594 days (range: 224-972 days). Within 1 week post treatment, eight dogs (73%) developed grade 2 and four dogs (36%) grade 1 acute toxicity in the perianal region. All acute toxicities resolved or improved to grade 1 within 3 weeks after treatment. Late toxicity, for example, chronic colitis/diarrhoea, ulcerations, strictures or myelopathies was not observed in any patient. Five dogs were euthanized 105, 196, 401, 508 and 908 days after RT and six dogs were still alive, one in spite of progressive disease. The median progression-free survival was 908 days (95%CI: 215; 1602).

25698980,"Common consequences of long-term psychosocial stress are fatigue and burnout. It has been suggested that burnout could be associated with hypocortisolism, thus, inability to produce sufficient amounts of cortisol. This study aimed to investigate whether patients with clinical burnout exhibit aberrant ACTH and cortisol responses under acute psychosocial stress compared with healthy individuals. Nineteen patients (9 men and 10 women) and 37 healthy subjects (20 men and 17 women), underwent the Trier Social Stress Test. Blood samples and saliva samples were collected before, after, and during the stress test for measurements of plasma ACTH, serum cortisol, and salivary cortisol. Several statistical analyses were conducted to compare the responses between patients and controls. In addition, in order to investigate the possibility that burnout patients with more severe symptoms would respond differently, sub-groups of patients reporting higher and lower burnout scores were compared. In both patients and healthy controls, we observed elevated levels of ACTH and cortisol after exposure to the stressor. There were no differences in responses of ACTH, serum cortisol, or salivary cortisol between patients and controls. Patients reporting higher burnout scores had lower salivary cortisol responses than controls, indicating that patients with more severe burnout symptoms may be suffering from hypocortisolism. In addition, patients with more severe burnout symptoms tended to have smaller ACTH responses than the other patients. However, there was no corresponding difference in serum cortisol. This study indicates that hypocortisolism is not present in a clinical burnout patient group as a whole but may be present in the patients with more severe burnout symptoms.",valid

Consequently, inhibiting STAT3 is recognized as a promising and effective strategy for therapeutic intervention against breast cancer. We herein synthesize a library of isoxazole (PAIs) from piperic acid [2E, 4E)-5-(2H-1,3-Benzodioxol-5-yl) penta-2,4-dienoic acid] on treatment with propargyl bromide followed by oxime under prescribed reaction conditions. Piperic acid was obtained by hydrolysis of piperine extracted from Piper nigrum. First, we checked the binding potential of isoxazole derivatives with breast cancer target proteins by network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and cytotoxicity analysis as potential anti-breast cancer (BC) agents. The multi-source databases were used to identify possible targets for isoxazole derivatives. A network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) was generated by obtaining 877 target genes that overlapped gene symbols associated with isoxazole derivatives and BC. Molecular docking and MD modelling demonstrated a strong affinity between isoxazole derivatives and essential target genes. Further, the cell viability studies of isoxazole derivatives on the human breast carcinoma cell lines showed toxicity in all breast cancer cell lines. In summary, our study indicated that the isoxazole derivative showed the significant anticancer activity. The results highlight the prospective utility of isoxazole derivatives as new drug candidates for anticancer chemotherapy, suggesting route for the continued exploration and development of drugs suitable for clinical applications.",valid
26381121,"Bacterial spores can remain dormant for decades, yet harbor the exceptional capacity to rapidly resume metabolic activity and recommence life. Although germinants and their corresponding receptors have been known for more than 30 years, the molecular events underlying this remarkable cellular transition from dormancy to full metabolic activity are only partially defined. Here, we examined whether protein phospho-modifications occur during germination, the first step of exiting dormancy, thereby facilitating spore revival. Utilizing Bacillus subtilis as a model organism, we performed phosphoproteomic analysis to define the Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphoproteome of a reviving spore. The phosphoproteome was found to chiefly comprise newly identified phosphorylation sites located within proteins involved in basic biological functions, such as transcription, translation, carbon metabolism, and spore-specific determinants. Quantitative comparison of dormant and germinating spore phosphoproteomes revealed phosphorylation dynamics, indicating that phospho-modifications could modulate protein activity during this cellular transition. Furthermore, by mutating select phosphorylation sites located within proteins representative of key biological processes, we established a functional connection between phosphorylation and the progression of spore revival. Herein, we provide, for the first time, a phosphoproteomic view of a germinating bacterial spore. We further show that the spore phosphoproteome is dynamic and present evidence that phosphorylation events play an integral role in facilitating spore revival.",valid
23618404,"Functional magnetic resonance (fMR) imaging offers plenty of new opportunities in the diagnosis of central nervous system diseases. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a technique sensitive to the random motion of water providing information about tissue architecture. We applied DTI to normal appearing spinal cords of 13 dogs of different breeds and body weights in a 3.0 T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner. The aim was to study fiber tracking (FT) patterns by tractography and the variations of the fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) observed in the spinal cords of dogs with different sizes and at different locations (cervical and thoracolumbar). For that reason we added a DTI sequence to the standard clinical MR protocol. The values of FA and ADC were calculated by means of three regions of interest defined on the cervical or the thoracolumbar spinal cord (ROI 1, 2, and 3). The shape of the spinal cord fiber tracts was well illustrated following tractography and the exiting nerve roots could be differentiated from the spinal cord fiber tracts. Routine MR scanning times were extended for 8 to 12 min, depending on the size of the field of view (FOV), the slice thickness, and the size of the interslice gaps. In small breed dogs (<15 kg body weight) the fibers could be tracked over a length of approximately 10 vertebral bodies with scanning times of about 8 min, whereas in large breed dogs (>25 kg body weight) the traceable fiber length was about 5 vertebral bodies which took 10 to 12 min scanning time. FA and ADC values showed mean values of 0.447 (FA), and 0.560×10(-3) mm2/s (ADC), respectively without any differences detected with regard to different dog sizes and spinal cord 45 segments examined. FT is suitable for the graphical depiction of the canine spinal cord and the exiting nerve roots. The FA and ADC values offer an objective measure for evaluation of the spinal cord fiber integrity in dogs.",valid
17450380,"Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) blistering occurs as a result of the disruption of intercellular contacts among keratinocytes, or acantholysis. The hallmark of PV acantholysis in vitro is considered to be the retraction of keratin intermediate filaments (KIF) onto the nucleus, which parallels with loss of cell-cell adhesion and rounding up of keratinocytes. However, the fine morphological changes of keratinocytes as well as the fate of cell adhesion structures cannot be appreciated on immunofluorescence by the simple cytokeratin staining. In this paper, we show that acantholytic dysmorphisms are sharply investigated by using PV IgG as a primary antibody on metabolically quiescent living cells. Indeed, PV IgG recognise a wide spectrum of molecules and enabled us to monitor the main changes occurring in acantholytic keratinocytes, including cell shrinkage with the appearance of prickle-like processes, detachment of keratinocytes from one another and collapse of cytoskeleton-bound proteins along nuclear periphery. This method has wider applications as it could be useful for staining cell periphery of keratinocytes and changes in cell shape. Furthermore, images displayed clear and sharp contours because living cell microscopy allows to avoid antigen distortion due to cell manipulation, which usually precedes the immunolabelling.",valid

Different molecular approaches that are not culture dependent have been proposed to circumvent these limits. On the basis of the robust experience previously obtained with bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs)-on-Beads™ (BoBs™), we evaluated the same technology that we had used for the analysis of prenatal samples on POCs. KaryoLite™ BoBs™ includes 91 beads, each of which is conjugated with a composite of multiple neighboring BACs according to the hg19 assembly.

36056952,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common neoplasms in adults, and it is difficult to achieve satisfactory results with conventional drugs. Here, we synthesized a novel organic arsenic derivative MZ2 and evaluated its ability to remodel energy metabolism to achieve anti-leukemia. MZ2 was characterized by the average 1-min full mass spectra analysis. Biological methods such as Western blot, qPCR, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy were used to assess the mode and mechanism of MZ2-induced death. The in vivo efficacy of MZ2 was assessed by constructing a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) AML model. Unlike the precursor organic arsenical Z2, MZ2 can effectively reduce the level of aerobic glycolysis. Our in-depth found that MZ2 inhibited the expression of PDK2 in a dose-dependent manner and did not affect the expression of LDHA, another key enzyme of the glycolytic pathway. MZ2 reconstituted energy metabolism to induce the generation of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) and then triggerd intrinsic apoptosis pathway. We also assessed whether MZ2 generates autophagy and results showed that MZ2 can induce autophagy of AML cells, which may be associated with the precursor organic arsenic drug. In vivo, MZ2 effectively attenuated leukemia progression in mice, and immunohistochemical results suggested its PDK2 inhibitory effect. In summary, the novel organic arsine derivative MZ2 exhibited excellent anti-tumor effects in acute myeloid leukemia, which may provide a potential strategy for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.",valid
21647536,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a sensor and regulator of cellular energy metabolism potentially implicated in a broad range of conditions, including obesity and Alzheimer's disease. Its role in the control of key metabolic enzymes makes this kinase a central player in glucose and lipid homeostasis. Recently, by screening a library of synthetic small molecules selected for their structural similarity with the natural polyphenol resveratrol, we identified RSVA314 and RSVA405 as potent indirect activators of AMPK (half-maximal effective concentration [EC₅₀] = 1 μmol/L in cell-based assays). Here we show that RSVA314 and RSVA405 can significantly activate AMPK and inhibit acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), one target of AMPK and a key regulator of fatty acid biogenesis, in nondifferentiated and proliferating 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We found that RSVA314 and RSVA405 treatments inhibited 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation by interfering with mitotic clonal expansion during preadipocyte proliferation (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC₅₀] = 0.5 μmol/L). RSVA314 and RSVA405 prevented the adipogenesis-dependent transcriptional changes of multiple gene products involved in the adipogenic process, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), fatty acid synthase, fatty acid binding protein 4 (aP2), RANTES or resistin. Furthermore, orally administered RSVA405 at 20 and 100 mg/kg/d significantly reduced the body weight gain of mice fed a high-fat diet. This work shows that the novel small-molecule activators of AMPK (RSVA314 and RSVA405) are potent inhibitors of adipogenesis and thus may have therapeutic potential against obesity.",valid

Evidence of complete spontaneous regression of residual NMSC exists in the case of small lesions macroscopically removed by shave biopsy, but with a positive microscopic margin. The present study investigates the rate at which residual tumor is present at subsequent excisional biopsy, with the aim to assess if recommendation to forgo surgical excision can be made. A total of 233 shave biopsies of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were performed during a 5-year period. All specimens included in the study were less than 2 cm in diameter, were macroscopically removed by shave biopsy, and had a positive initial microscopic margin. On subsequent surgical excisional biopsy, 42% of BCC specimens were negative for residual tumor, 38% had residual tumor, but the tumor was completely contained in the excised specimen, and 20% of the specimens had positive margin residual tumor. For SCC specimens, 73% were negative for residual tumor, 21% had residual tumor, but the tumor was completely contained in the excised specimen, and 6% of the specimens had positive margin residual tumor. Although reduction of residual tumor at reexcision is noted with both BCC and even more so with SCC, the rate at which this occurs is not sufficient that a general recommendation to forgo surgical excision can be made.",valid
12657456,"Cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) are often used to analyze activity-dependent neuronal selection occurring during brain development. The CGNs survive long only when the culture medium contains a depolarizing agent. However, it is argued whether the depolarization critical for survival is of presynaptic or postsynaptic compartment. Since CGNs form no synapses among them, it is generally assumed that the latter would be the case. But it is possible that the depolarization would induce exocytosis of survival-promoting substances whether or not CGNs form synapses. Here we directly examined the exocytotic activities of CGNs under survival-promoting and survival-limiting conditions by electron microscopy to support this possibility. CGNs possessed clusters of synaptic vesicle-like vesicles (SVVs) in neuritic varicosities. CGNs cultured in high-KCl medium had significantly smaller SVV clusters than those cultured in low-KCl medium. The number of SVVs increased when the high KCl-cultured CGNs were transferred to low-KCl medium, indicating a sustained high rate of exocytosis in high-KCl medium. The majority of the varicosities containing SVVs were not apposed to definite postsynaptic structures, indicating that exocytosis occurs from a non-synaptic surface. Fluorescence Ca(2+) imaging revealed that the high KCl-cultured CGNs had spots of high Ca(2+) along their neurites, corresponding to the varicosities.",valid

In the absence of deuterium decoupling, the (13)C line widths observed for the deuterated samples are identical to those observed for the perprotio samples with a MAS rate of 20 kHz. Extensive deuteration has little effect on the T(1) of the exchangeable protons.

To describe the prevalence, incidence, 12 co-morbidity factors and correlates of threshold and subthreshold PMDD in a community sample of young women. Findings are based on prospective-longitudinal community survey of 1488 women aged 14-24, who were followed-up over a period of 48 months (follow-up, N = 1,251) as part of the EDSP sample. Diagnostic assessments were based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and its 12-month PMDD diagnostic module administered by clinical interviewers. Diagnoses were calculated using DSM-IV algorithms, but daily ratings of symptoms, as required, were not available. The baseline 12-month prevalence of DSM-IV PMDD was 5.8%. Application of the diagnostic exclusion rules with regard to concurrent major depression and dysthymia decreased the rate only slightly (5.3%). An additional 18.6 % were 'near-threshold' cases, mostly because they failed to meet the mandatory impairment criterion. Over the follow-up period only few new PMDD cases were observed: cumulative lifetime incidence was 7.4%. PMDD syndrome was stable across 48 months with < 10% complete remissions among baseline PMDD cases. The 12-month and lifetime co-morbidity rates were high (anxiety disorders 47.4%, mood disorders 22.9%; somatoform 28.4%), only 26.5 % had no other mental disorder. Particularly high odds ratios were found with nicotine dependence and PTSD. In terms of correlates increased rates of 4-weeks impairment days, high use of general health and mental health services, and increased rates of suicide attempts were found. In this sample of adolescents and young adults, premenstrual symptoms were widespread. However, DSM-IV PMDD was considerably less prevalent. PMDD is a relatively stable and impairing condition, with high rates of health service utilization, increased suicidality and substantial co-morbidity.",valid

This exploratory review focused on psychological counselling for genetic risk diagnosis. This study aimed to address the psychological management of the impact of genetic risk on chronic diseases. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Scopus for articles from May 2012 to August 2023. A descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the included studies was conducted. Based on the exclusion/inclusion criteria, the literature search yielded 250 studies. Seventeen full texts were assessed for eligibility and 207 articles were excluded. Observational (n = 15) and randomised clinical trials (n = 2) were examined. Most studies have been conducted on oncological diagnoses; the emotional dimensions examined have been worry, depression, anxiety and stress in most diseases. Psychological measures are based on self-reports and questionnaires; few studies have investigated the connections between quality of life, psychological traits and emotional dimensions. The complexity of clinics and from daily diagnostic and treatment practices to the everyday experience of those living with the risk of disease might be addressed in counselling settings to improve quality of life in genetic risk, increasing mental adaptation to tailored chronic conditions.

Metacyclic forms of all Leishmania species display a typical morphology with short, narrow cell body, and an elongated flagellum. This feature suggests that metacyclics can be distinguished from procyclic forms by non-fluorimetric flow cytometric parameters thus enabling the follow-up of their appearance and acquisition of specific properties, during metacyclogenesis in in vitro cultures. Here we describe the flow cytometric parameters of stage-specific promastigotes of Leishmania major, Leishmania donovani, Leishmania amazonensis, and Leishmania braziliensis. Our findings were validated by optical microscopy morphology and specific procyclic labeling with FITC-peanut agglutinin. Furthermore, we show that parasite's distribution in the plot during differentiation in culture is not species specific and that the parasites displaying low forward-angle light scatter (FSC(low)) are three times more infective than the FSC(high) ones. The method here described can be applied to the identification of metacyclics of different Leishmania spp within the whole stationary population.",valid

Advances in catheter- and surgery-based cardiac interventions have rendered almost all types of CHD amenable to complete correction or at least palliation. Patient survival has increased, and a new patient population, referred to as adult CHD (ACHD) patients, has emerged. Implanted prosthetic material paves the way for cardiovascular device-related infections, but studies on the management of CHD-associated IE in the era of cardiovascular devices are scarce. The types of heart malformation (unrepaired, repaired, palliated) substantially differ in their lifetime risks for IE. Streptococci and staphylococci are the predominant pathogens. Right-sided IE is more frequently seen in patients with CHD. Relevant comorbidity caused by cardiac and extracardiac episode-related complications is high. Transesophageal echocardiography is recommended for more precise visualization of vegetations, especially in complex type of CHD in ACHD patients. Antimicrobial therapy and surgical management of IE remain challenging, but outcome of CHD-associated IE from the neonate to the adult is better than in other forms of IE. Primary prevention of IE is vital and includes good dental health and skin hygiene; antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated only in high-risk patients undergoing oral mucosal procedures.",valid

Each ejaculate from three males was treated with four published cryopreservation protocols (Seier et al. 1993; Sanchez-Partida et al. 2000; Si et al. 2000; Isachenko et al. 2005). Upon thawing, each sub-sample was incubated either at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 in air with or without activators or at approximately 22 degrees C in atmospheric air without activators for 0-24 h. Samples cryopreserved using one method showed zero motility and were not included in the 2 ;2 G-test statistical analysis. The other methods all demonstrated good immediate post-thaw motility rates (68%, 73% and 62% respectively) and underwent capacitation after exposure to activators. Sperm motility in each treatment decreased over time at both temperatures but overall, incubation at 22 degrees C preserved motility better in all three methods. In summary, cryopreservation of rhesus spermatozoa using the method published by Sanchez-Partida et al. or Seier et al. appeared best, potentially supporting gene banking as well as allowing for multiple IVF uses from the same sample.",valid
22059768,"The effects of rabbit diets with four different levels of barley and sugar-beet pulp on the dressing percentage, chemical and fatty acid composition of meat from rabbits slaughtered at a liveweight of 2000 and 2500 g have been studied. Results revealed detectable (P < 0·05) effects of the total substitution of barley by sugar-beet pulp for carcass weight, dressing percentage and dry matter from animals slaughtered at a liveweight of 2000 g. No significant differences (P > 0·05) among batches were observed when slaughter weight was 2500 g. No influence of the diet on the total lipid fatty acids was found. In general, similar results were found when rabbit diets were formulated with 50% barley and 0% sugar-beet pulp, 30% barley and 0% sugar-beet pulp or 15% barley and 15% sugar-beet pulp.",valid
16157670,"The extent to which epistasis contributes to adaptation, population differentiation, and speciation is a long-standing and important problem in evolutionary genetics. Using recombinant inbred (RI) lines of Arabidopsis thaliana grown under natural field conditions, we have examined the genetic architecture of fitness-correlated traits with respect to epistasis; we identified both single-locus additive and two-locus epistatic QTL for natural variation in fruit number, germination, and seed length and width. For fruit number, we found seven significant epistatic interactions, but only two additive QTL. For seed germination, length, and width, there were from two to four additive QTL and from five to eight epistatic interactions. The epistatic interactions were both positive and negative. In each case, the magnitude of the epistatic effects was roughly double that of the effects of the additive QTL, varying from -41% to +29% for fruit number and from -5% to +4% for seed germination, length, and width. A number of the QTL that we describe participate in more than one epistatic interaction, and some loci identified as additive also may participate in an epistatic interaction; the genetic architecture for fitness traits may be a network of additive and epistatic effects. We compared the map positions of the additive and epistatic QTL for germination, seed width, and seed length from plants grown in both the field and the greenhouse. While the total number of significant additive and epistatic QTL was similar under the two growth conditions, the map locations were largely different. We found a small number of significant epistatic QTL x environment effects when we tested directly for them. Our results support the idea that epistatic interactions are an important part of natural genetic variation and reinforce the need for caution in comparing results from greenhouse-grown and field-grown plants.",valid
20362398,"The risk of mortality is high in burn patients and correlates with age, burn area extent, and sepsis. Immunosuppression has been reported to occur after severe burn. Cytotoxic cells possess specialized granules containing perforin and a group of serine proteases (granzymes). Granzyme A is a serine protease constitutively expressed by gammadelta and NK cells, in agreement with their functional cytolytic potential. In vitro studies have shown that GrA may be released extracellularly during cytotoxic cell degranulation, indicating the activation of cytotoxic cells. The aim of our study was to determine plasma GrA activity in burned patients and to verify if decreased GrA levels were associated with poor prognosis. Specific GrA activity was tested in the plasma of burned and healthy subjects by esterase assay. Plasma GrA was significantly decreased in septic rather than in nonseptic burn patients and in healthy subjects (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). At day 3 plasma GrA was significantly lower in nonsurvivor than in survivor septic patients (p < 0.05). The value of 91 mOD showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 84% in differentiating survivor from nonsurvivor septic patients. Because this is a retrospective study, Granzyme A is not a confirmed predictor of septic outcome after burn, but its determination could give useful information about the development and severity of sepsis.",valid

Eyes with non-neovascular AMD (n = 32), neovascular AMD (n = 30), thick and thin choroid PCV (n = 33 and 27), and CSC (n = 34) were enrolled. Subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and the presence and patterns of pachyvessels were assessed. En face images of the large choroidal vessel layer were converted to binary images for the analysis of vascular density. Pachyvessels were identified in 8 (25%), 14 (46%), 28 (85%), 26 (96%), and 34 (100%) non-neovascular AMD, neovascular AMD, thin choroid PCV, thick choroid PCV, and CSC eyes, respectively (P < 0.001). The pattern of pachyvessels was focal in non-neovascular AMD (100%), neovascular AMD (79%), and thin choroid PCV (89%) while the pattern was mostly diffuse in CSC (88%) and thick choroid PCV (81%).

21387754,"Monitoring of chronic myeloid leukemia treatment efficacy requires very sensitive methods of BCR-ABL gene detection based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The lack of comparability of BCR-ABL mRNA quantification results generated by various methodologies in different laboratories was the cause of an international multicenter trial initiation with the participation of 133 laboratories in 24 European countries cooperating within the ""EUTOS for CML"" project. Pracownia Diagnostyki Molekularnej Kliniki Hematologii is taking part in standardisation rounds organised since 2005. The compatibility of methodology used in Pracownia with European Leukemia Net (ELN) standards was confirmed, and correction factor for the expression of RQ-PCR results in an international scale was calculated. Pracownia was charge by ELN with a task of conducting the standardisation in polish molecular biology laboratories. Test probes were prepared and sent to eight cooperating laboratories. The results obtained in six laboratories were concordant with results from laboratory in Krakow after conversion to international scale, therefore it was possible to calculate individual correction factors. The participation of polish laboratories in international standardization process created the opportunity for unification of BCR-ABL quantification methodologies with recommendations of international experts, and showed that the quality of analyses performed in majority of them was satisfactory enough to calculate correction factor and to express the RQ-PCR results in widely accepted international scale.",valid

22105339,"The primary objective of the current study was to examine the extent to which domain-specific time perspective predicts weight management behaviors (dietary behavior and physical activity) among those newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. A secondary objective was to test potential mediators of the hypothesized effect (behavioral intention, self-efficacy and control beliefs). A total of 204 adults newly diagnosed (≤6 months) with Type 2 diabetes participated in the study, which included a baseline assessment of domain-general and domain-specific time perspective, as well as strength of intention to perform two weight-management behaviors (dietary choice and physical activity); both weight-management behaviors were assessed again at 6 month follow-up. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed a prospective association between domain-specific time perspective and uptake of weight management behaviors. Individuals with newly diagnosed T2DM possessing a future-oriented time perspective reported making less frequent fatty food choices and greater increases in physical activity over the 6-month follow-up interval. These effects were selectively mediated by intention strength, and not competing social cognitive variables. For both behaviors, the total effects and meditational models were robust to adjustments for demographics, body composition and disease variables. A future-oriented time perspective is prospectively associated with superior uptake of weight management behaviors among those with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes. The facilitating effect of future-oriented thinking appears to occur via enhanced strength of intentions to perform weight management behaviors.",valid
27860072,"Injuries of the plantar soft tissues of the tarsus and proximal metatarsus can be a source of lameness in horses, however published information is lacking on high field MRI characteristics of these tissues. Objectives of the current anatomic study were to (1) describe high-field MRI features of the plantar tarsal and proximal metatarsal soft tissues; and (2) compare MRI findings with gross and histological appearances of selected structures for a sample of cadaver limbs from non-lame horses. Single hindlimbs for 42 horses, and right and left hindlimbs for eight horses were scanned using high-field MRI. The MRI findings were described for the 50 single limbs; and the MRI, gross postmortem and histological findings were compared for the eight pairs of hindlimbs. The superficial digital flexor tendon had uniform low signal intensity, surrounded by the flexor retinaculum of intermediate to high signal intensity on all sequences. The lateral digital flexor tendon had slightly higher signal intensity, enclosed on the plantaromedial aspects by the low signal intensity metatarsocalcaneal ligament. The accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon varied in size and signal intensity. The proximal and distal plantar ligaments, accessory ligament of the suspensory ligament, and calcaneoquartal ligament had low signal intensity. The long plantar ligament comprised a number of related parts, separated by lines of high signal intensity corresponding with fibrous septae seen in gross anatomical specimens. The plantar aspect of the ligament had uniform low signal intensity in all sequences, but the dorsal half was more heterogeneous with multifocal spots or lines of higher signal intensity.",valid
2673693,"Miglitol (BAYm 1099), an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, reduces the postprandial increase of blood glucose and serum insulin levels in type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, as shown in short-term studies. In this study, the effects of long-term miglitol treatment on metabolic control, C-peptide secretion, hepatic glucose output, and peripheral insulin sensitivity (euglycemic clamp) were tested in 15 type II diabetic patients (8 receiving insulin, 7 receiving oral hypoglycemic agents). For 8 wk they received either miglitol (300 mg/day) or placebo with a double-blind crossover design that had a 4-wk washout period between treatments. Miglitol therapy induced a reduction of postprandial blood glucose levels (miglitol compared with placebo; areas under the curve; P less than .002), whereas fasting blood glucose levels were not influenced. Miglitol caused a slight reduction of glycosylated hemoglobin levels (mean +/- SE miglitol and placebo 9.50 +/- 0.3 and 10.0 +/- 0.4%, respectively; P less than .05), which was more pronounced in insulin-treated patients. Miglitol caused a reduction of postprandial C-peptide increase (P less than .03). Hepatic glucose output (both in the basal state and during euglycemic clamp conditions) and peripheral insulin sensitivity were not influenced by miglitol therapy. Specific side effects were observed in 11 patients; in 6 patients only to a moderate degree. Long-term miglitol treatment induces a persistent reduction of postprandial blood glucose increase. This effect is more pronounced in type II diabetic patients on insulin therapy, which can cause a moderate improvement of overall metabolic control.",valid
28725682,"Non-motor symptoms (NMS) are a key component of Parkinson's disease (PD). A range of NMS, most notably impaired sense of smell, sleep dysfunction, and dysautonomia are present from the 'pre-motor' phase to the final palliative stage. Theories as to the pathogenesis of PD such as those proposed by Braak and others also support the occurrence of NMS in PD years before motor symptoms start. However, research addressing the range and nature of NMS in PD has been confounded by the fact that many NMS arise as part of drug-related side effects. Thus, drug-naive PD (DNPD) patients provide an ideal population to study the differences in the presentation of NMS. The aim of this paper is therefore to systematically review all the available studies of NMS in DNPD patients. We believe this is the first review of its kind. The current review confirms the increasing research being conducted into NMS in DNPD patients as well as the necessity for further investigation into less-studied NMS, such as pain. Moreover, the data confirms non-motor heterogeneity among PD patients, and, therefore, further research into the concept of non-motor subtyping is encouraged. The review suggests that the clinical assessment of NMS should be integral to any assessment of PD in clinical and research settings.",valid
23349711,"Many practical problems in almost all scientific and technological disciplines have been classified as computationally hard (NP-hard or even NP-complete). In life sciences, combinatorial optimization problems frequently arise in molecular biology, e.g., genome sequencing; global alignment of multiple genomes; identifying siblings or discovery of dysregulated pathways. In almost all of these problems, there is the need for proving a hypothesis about certain property of an object that can be present if and only if it adopts some particular admissible structure (an NP-certificate) or be absent (no admissible structure), however, none of the standard approaches can discard the hypothesis when no solution can be found, since none can provide a proof that there is no admissible structure. This article presents an algorithm that introduces a novel type of solution method to ""efficiently"" solve the graph 3-coloring problem; an NP-complete problem. The proposed method provides certificates (proofs) in both cases: present or absent, so it is possible to accept or reject the hypothesis on the basis of a rigorous proof. It provides exact solutions and is polynomial-time (i.e., efficient) however parametric. The only requirement is sufficient computational power, which is controlled by the parameter α∈N. Nevertheless, here it is proved that the probability of requiring a value of α>k to obtain a solution for a random graph decreases exponentially: P(α>k)≤2(-(k+1)), making tractable almost all problem instances. Thorough experimental analyses were performed. The algorithm was tested on random graphs, planar graphs and 4-regular planar graphs. The obtained experimental results are in accordance with the theoretical expected results.",valid
16633665,"The X-ray absorption near-edge structures (XANES) at the F K-edge of alpha-AlF(3), beta-AlF(3) and a tetragonal AlF(3) phase are analysed by a combination of ab initio calculations with the FEFF8 code and a phenomenological discussion of local molecular orbital (MO) symmetries at the absorbing fluorine atoms. By means of a Walsh correlation diagram it is shown that the two intense absorption bands observed at the F K-edges of the AlF(3) polymorphs can be interpreted as transitions to anti-bonding MOs in [Al-F-Al]-units that have C(2v) and D(infinity h) point group symmetries. The energies of both anti-bonding orbitals are very insensitive to the angle between the Al-F bonds, which explains the close similarity of the XANES signatures from the three polymorphs. The FEFF8 analysis shows that the increased broadening of the XANES structure for beta-AlF(3) and the tetragonal AlF(3) phase is due to the superposition of the individual absorption spectra from the crystallographically distinct F species. The interpretation in terms of local MOs provides for the first time a ""chemically intuitive"" approach to investigations of solid fluorides by XANES spectroscopy and provides a simple conceptual framework for the discussion of the electronic structure in AlF(3) materials.",valid
32245258,"The main purpose of the study was to develop a high accuracy system able to diagnose skin lesions using deep learning-based methods. We propose a new decision system based on multiple classifiers like neural networks and feature-based methods. Each classifier (method) gives the final decision system a certain weight, depending on the calculated accuracy, helping the system make a better decision. First, we created a neural network (NN) that can differentiate melanoma from benign nevus. The NN architecture is analyzed by evaluating it during the training process. Some biostatistic parameters, such as accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and Dice coefficient are calculated. Then, we developed three other methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNNs were pre-trained using large ImageNet and Places365 databases. GoogleNet, ResNet-101, and NasNet-Large, were used in the enumeration order. CNN architectures were fine-tuned in order to distinguish the different types of skin lesions using transfer learning. The accuracies of the classifications were determined. The last proposed method uses the classical method of image object detection, more precisely, the one in which some features are extracted from the images, followed by the classification step. In this case, the classification was done by using a support vector machine. Just as in the first method, the sensitivity, specificity, Dice similarity coefficient and accuracy are determined. A comparison of the obtained results from all the methods is then done. As mentioned above, the novelty of this paper is the integration of these methods in a global fusion-based decision system that uses the results obtained by each individual method to establish the fusion weights. The results obtained by carrying out the experiments on two different free databases shows that the proposed system offers higher accuracy results.",valid

Despite use of the term thymoma in the nomenclature, there is no evidence of thymic origin or differentiation. It affects middle-aged adults with a remarkable male predominance. To date less than 80 cases have been reported in the English literature. We present here two additional cases of EHT. The first is a benign case in a 31-year-old man, showing typical histological features. The second is a malignant case in a 70-year-old woman, showing intraductal carcinoma arising in intimate association with an EHT. These cases are presented in the context of a review of cases reported in the English literature. The exact origin has not been identified, but is considered to be of branchial apparatus, creating a quandary about the best terminology. Recently, the designation ""branchial anlage mixed tumor"" or ""thymic anlage tumor"" were proposed, but do not quite reflect the true nature of the neoplasm. To avoid taxonomic confusion, international consensus on terminology is desired. As this entity is a neoplasm that shows dual mesoderm and endoderm derivation/differentiation, we propose a new name ""biphenotypic branchioma.""",valid

37403020,"Inflammation of the fetal membranes is an indispensable event of labor onset at both term and preterm birth. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is known to participate in inflammation via ST2 (suppression of tumorigenicity 2) receptor as an inflammatory cytokine. However, it remains unknown whether IL-33/ST2 axis exists in human fetal membranes to promote inflammatory reactions in parturition. The presence of IL-33 and ST2 and their changes at parturition were examined with transcriptomic sequencing, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting or immunohistochemistry in human amnion obtained from term and preterm birth with or without labor. Cultured primary human amnion fibroblasts were utilized to investigate the regulation and the role of IL-33/ST2 axis in the inflammation reactions. A mouse model was used to further study the role of IL-33 in parturition. Although IL-33 and ST2 expression were detected in both epithelial and fibroblast cells of human amnion, they are more abundant in amnion fibroblasts. Their abundance increased significantly in the amnion at both term and preterm birth with labor. Lipopolysaccharide, serum amyloid A1 and IL-1β, the inflammatory mediators pertinent to labor onset, could all induce IL-33 expression through NF-κB activation in human amnion fibroblasts. In turn, via ST2 receptor, IL-33 induced the production of IL-1β, IL-6 and PGE2 in human amnion fibroblasts via the MAPKs-NF-κB pathway. Moreover, IL-33 administration induced preterm birth in mice. IL-33/ST2 axis is present in human amnion fibroblasts, which is activated in both term and preterm labor. Activation of this axis leads to increased production of inflammatory factors pertinent to parturition, and results in preterm birth. Targeting the IL-33/ST2 axis may have potential value in the treatment of preterm birth.",valid

Since 2000, more than ten new lethal Amanita species have been discovered and some of them had caused severe mushroom poisonings in China. However, the contents and distribution of cyclopeptides in these lethal mushrooms remain poorly known. In this study, the diversity of major cyclopeptide toxins in seven Amanita species from Eastern Asia and three species from Europe and North America were systematically analyzed, and a new approach to inferring phylogenetic relationships using cyclopeptide profile was evaluated for the first time. The results showed that there were diversities of the cyclopeptides among lethal Amanita species, and cyclopeptides from Amanita rimosa and Amanita fuligineoides were reported for the first time. The amounts of amatoxins in East Asian Amanita species were significantly higher than those in European and North American species. The analysis of distribution of amatoxins and phallotoxins in various Amanita species demonstrated that the content of phallotoxins was higher than that of amatoxins in Amanita phalloides and Amanita virosa. In contrast, the content of phallotoxins was significantly lower than that of amatoxins in all East Asian lethal Amanita species tested. However, the distribution of amatoxins and phallotoxins in different tissues showed the same tendency. Eight cyclopeptides and three unknown compounds were identified using cyclopeptide standards and high-resolution MS.

All patients who were operated for MITLIF using the one-step technique over the last 6 months period at a single institute, were retrospectively identified. The surgical technique is described and depicted. Outcome evaluation was performed, including screw misplacement, screw insertion time, and post-operative complications. We describe a novel technique modification in which self-drilling self-tapping navigated screws incorporate an embedded K-wire that enables a one-step insertion which obviates the need for instrument exchange. The first four patients in whom this technique was implemented were included (mean age was 55). All patients had been previously operated at the fused level. The mean surgical duration was 142 minutes and the calculated mean screw insertion time was 8.2 minutes. The mean estimated blood loss was 66 cc. An intraoperative 3D scan demonstrated no screw pedicle breach. There were no neurological complications or wound healing disturbances. The clinical course was uneventful for all patients. To our knowledge, the use of one-step navigation-assisted self-drilling self-tapping pedicle screws with an embedded K-wire has not been previously described.

Surgeries consisted of 19 (35.8%) PK procedures and 34 (64.2%) DSAEK procedures. Demographic, preoperative, and postoperative data including IOP, number of medications, rejection and occurrence, and complications were recorded. Patients who had undergone DSAEK had statistically significant lower IOP throughout 12 months after surgery than those who had undergone PK (p = 0.028), despite similar use of IOP-lowering medications during this time. Measurements of postoperative IOP greater than 21 mm Hg and greater than 30 mm Hg were significantly more common in patients who had undergone PK than DSAEK (p = 0.015 and 0.022, respectively). Complication rates were similar between the 2 groups. IOP was not correlated with patient age, sex, background illnesses, or previous glaucoma. IOP is significantly lower after DSAEK compared with PK. Several mechanisms explaining this difference are proposed.

This pathway may involve not only pathogens, but also self proteins, and may thus be involved in self-tolerance. We have characterized the processing of the endoplasmic reticulum-restricted glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus, termed poison tail (Gpt), biochemically and enzymatically, and by T cell recognition assays. Expressed with a vaccinia vector, Gpt remains endoglycosidase H-sensitive and does not mature to endoglycosidase D sensitivity. The protein is degraded in the ER with a T1/2 of 4 h. Gpt peptides are not secreted since Gpt-infected cells are unable to sensitize uninfected antigen-presenting cells in an innocent bystander assay. Using flow cytometry, Gpt is undetectable on the plasma membrane; in contrast, wild-type G is readily found on the surface or secreted into the milieu as soluble G following infection of A20 cells with a vaccinia recombinant expressing G. The degradation of Gpt is sensitive to the thiol reagent diamide and occurs optimally at physiological pH. A series of proteolytic inhibitors were tested: 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone inhibited degradation, which suggests the involvement of a serine protease. The degradation does not require transport to the Golgi complex, and is not sensitive to a variety of lysosomotropic agents.

Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into four groups of six mice each (control, exercise alone, LAB12 and LAB12 + exercise). Mice treated with the potential probiotic LAB12 were orally gavaged for 42 days. At autopsy, blood and spleen from the animals were collected. The splenocytes were cultured in the presence of a mitogen, concanavalin A (Con A). The amount of TNF-α produced by the Con A-stimulated splenocytes was quantified using ELISA, while their proliferation was determined using the [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation method. This study shows that LAB12-supplemented and exercise-induced mice showed marked increase (P<0.05) in cell proliferation compared to the control animals. TNF-α production was suppressed (P<0.05) in the LAB12 group compared to the untreated mice.

22312193,"To identify non-housekeeping genes definitively expressed in the human trabecular meshwork (TM). Microarray gene expression data on TM cultured cells from four studies were compared. Genes that were queried in at least three studies and assessed to be expressed in at least three studies were considered definitively expressed genes of the human TM. Housekeeping genes were removed from this set of genes. The non-housekeeping TM gene profile was analyzed for pathway enrichment and microRNA targeting, using bioinformatics tools. The results were compared with results of previous non-array based studies. Nine hundred and sixty-two genes were identified as non-housekeeping TM expressed genes. Analysis of these by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes led to identification of two enriched biologic pathways that achieved a highly significant Bonferroni p-value (p≤0.01): focal adhesion and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction. Many of the genes were previously implicated in TM-related functions and the TM-associated disease glaucoma; however, some are novel. MicroRNAs known to be expressed in the trabecular meshwork were predicted to target some of the genes. Ten genes identified here, ALDH1A1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A1), CDH11 (cadherin 11, type 2, OB-cadherin), CXCR7 (chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 7), CHI3L1 (chitinase 3-like 1), FGF2 (fibroblast growth factor 2), GNG11 (guanine nucleotide binding protein [G protein], gamma 11), IGFBP5 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5), PTPRM (protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, M), RGS5 (regulator of G-protein signaling 5), and TUSC3 (tumor suppressor candidate 3), were also reported as TM expressed genes in three earlier non-microarray based studies. A transcriptome consisting of 962 non-housekeeping genes definitively expressed in the human TM was identified. Multiple genes and microRNAs are proposed for further study for a better understanding of TM physiology.",valid

Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 34,822 patch tested patients. NPT results were defined as negative or irritant final interpretations of all North American Contact Dermatitis Group screening allergens and no relevant allergens on supplemental series. Almost one-third of patients (n = 10,888 [31.3%]) had NPT results. Patients with NPT results were significantly more likely to be male (P < .0001), be age 40 years or younger (P = .0054), be nonwhite (P = .0005), and have dermatitis primarily having a scattered generalized distribution (P = .0007) or primarily located on the lips (P = .0214) or eyelids (P = .0364). However, the absolute differences in age, race, and site were small and may not be clinically meaningful. Patients with NPT results were significantly less likely to have occupationally related skin disease (P < .0001). Overall, 8.3% of patients with NPT results had occupationally related skin disease, with precision production worker/machine operator (28.5%), health care worker (17.0%), and mechanic/repairer (7.5%) being the most commonly related occupations. In all, 22.9% of patients with NPT results had relevant irritants and 41.6% of irritants were occupationally related; cosmetics/health care products and soaps were common sources for both occupationally related and non-occupationally related irritants.

We conducted a retrospective chart review of 279 affected males and 168 females from 27 sites (USA, Canada, Europe). The pre-defined study endpoints included progression of renal, cardiac and cerebrovascular involvement and/or death before the initiation of enzyme replacement therapy. The mean rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline for patients was -2.93 for males, and -1.02 ml/min/1.73 m(2)/year for females. Prevalence and severity of proteinuria, baseline eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and hypertension were associated with more rapid loss of eGFR. Advanced Fabry nephropathy was more prevalent and occurred earlier among males than females. Cardiac events (mainly arrhythmias), strokes and transient ischaemic attacks occurred in 49, 11, 6% of males, and in 35, 8, 4% of females, respectively. The mean age at death for 20 male patients was 49.9 years. Baseline proteinuria, reduced baseline eGFR, hypertension and male gender were associated with more rapid progression of Fabry nephropathy. The eGFR progression rate may increase with advancing nephropathy, and may differ between subgroups of patients with Fabry disease.",valid
28121620,"The ventral hypothalamus (VHT) integrates several physiological cues to maintain glucose homeostasis and energy balance. Aging is associated with increased glucose intolerance but the underlying mechanisms responsible for age-related metabolic decline, including neuronal signaling in the VHT, remain elusive. We have shown that mice with VHT-targeted overexpression of ∆FosB, a splice variant of the AP1 transcription factor FosB, exhibit increased energy expenditure, leading to decreased adiposity. Here, we show that VHT-targeted overexpression of ∆FosB also improves glucose tolerance, increases insulin sensitivity in target organs and thereby suppresses insulin secretion. These effects are also observed by the overexpression of dominant negative JunD, demonstrating that they occur via AP1 antagonism within the VHT. Furthermore, the improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity persisted in aged animals overexpressing ∆FosB in the VHT. These beneficial effects on glucose metabolism were abolished by peripheral sympathectomy and α-adrenergic, but not β-adrenergic, blockade. Taken together, our results show that antagonizing AP1 transcription activity in the VHT leads to a marked improvement in whole body glucose homeostasis via activation of the SNS, conferring protection against age-related impairment in glucose metabolism. These findings may open novel avenues for therapeutic intervention in diabetes and age-related glucose intolerance.",valid

We examined the effects of mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) fiber and sugar beet fiber on serum cholesterol and hepatic LDL receptor mRNA in rats. Rats were fed a cholesterol-free diet with 50 g/kg cellulose powder (CP), 50 g/kg mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) fiber (MSF) or 50 g/kg sugar beet fiber (BF) for 4 wk. There were no significant differences in the body weight, food intake and cecum weight among the groups. The relative liver weight in the CP group was significantly greater than that in the MSF and BF groups. The cecal pH in the CP and MSF groups was significantly higher than that in the BF group. Cecal acetic acid, butyric acid and total short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations in the BF group were significantly higher than those in the other groups. The serum total cholesterol, VLDL + intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) + LDL cholesterol concentrations in the CP group were significantly greater than those in the MSF and BF groups. The HDL cholesterol concentration in the MSF group was significantly lower than that in the CP group. The hepatic LDL receptor mRNA level in the MSF and BF groups was significantly higher than that in the CP group. The results of this study demonstrate that mushroom fiber and sugar beet fiber lowered the serum total cholesterol level by enhancement of the hepatic LDL receptor mRNA.",valid
27973479,"We theoretically and numerically investigate the nonparaxial self-accelerating beams in a Λ-type three-level energy system of rubidium atomic vapor in the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) window. In the EIT window, the absorption of the atomic vapor is small, and robust nonparaxial self-accelerating beams can be generated. The reason is that the energy of the tail transfers to the main lobe, which then maintains its shape, owing to the self-healing effect. Media with large absorption would demand large energy to compensate, and the tail would be lifted too high to maintain the profile of an accelerating beam, so that self-accelerating beams cannot be obtained any longer. An atomic vapor with small absorption is the ideal medium to produce such self-accelerating beams and, in return, self-accelerating beams may inspire new ideas in the research associated with atomic vapors and atomic-like ensembles.",valid
27033361,"The melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1), which is highly expressed in the lateral hypothalamus, plays a key role in energy homeostasis, obesity and other endocrine diseases. Hence, there is a major interest in in vivo imaging of this receptor. A PET tracer would allow non-invasive in vivo visualization and quantification of the MCHR1. The aim of the study was the ex vivo evaluation of the MCHR1 ligand [(18)F]FE@SNAP as a potential PET tracer for the MCHR1. [(18)F]FE@SNAP was injected directly into the jugular vein of awake naïve rats for ex vivo brain autoradiography, biodistribution and additional blood metabolite analysis. Blocking experiments were conducted using the unlabeled MCHR1 ligand SNAP-7941. A high uptake of [(18)F]FE@SNAP was observed in the lateral hypothalamus and the ventricular system. Both regions were significantly blocked by SNAP-7941. Biodistribution evinced the highest uptake in the kidneys, adrenals, lung and duodenum. Specific blocking with SNAP-7941 led to a significant tracer reduction in the heart and adrenals. In plasma samples, 47.73 ± 6.1 % of a hydrophilic radioactive metabolite was found 45 min after tracer injection. Since [(18)F]FE@SNAP uptake was significantly blocked in the lateral hypothalamus, there is strong evidence that [(18)F]FE@SNAP is a highly suitable agent for specific MCHR1 imaging in the central nervous system. Additionally, this finding is supported by the specific blocking in the ventricular system, where the MCHR1 is expressed in the ependymal cells. These findings suggest that [(18)F]FE@SNAP could serve as a useful imaging and therapy monitoring tool for MCHR1-related pathologies.",valid

Patients in Stage II on whom tracheostomy was performed early stood the best chance of survival and recovery. However, if the operation was delayed in Stage II patients, there was a much greater chance for complications to develop, mostly due to aspiration of secretions into the tracheobronchial tree with consequent bronchopneumonia. There were four deaths, all in Stage III patients undergoing tracheostomy, where no definite or conventional identifiable cause could be determined.

The study was conducted on adult LT recipients (deceased donor liver transplant [DDLT] and living donor liver transplant [LDLT]) from the Indian subcontinent, at post-LT clinic visit between July and December 2016. Recipient details included baseline demography, comorbidity, psychological status, details of addiction, indication and type of transplant. Details on financial support for transplantation, admissions for rejection, infection and posttransplant complications were obtained from the hospital records. An adherence questionnaire was completed by direct interview and using a questionnaire. Sixty-seven LT recipients (56 males, median age 48.17 years) constituted the study group. Overall, 11 patients (16.47%) were nonadherent to treatment. LDLT recipients were more adherent than DDLT recipients. Nonadherent recipients were believers in alternative systems of medicine. Medication-related factors such as improper dosing, meagre drug knowledge difficulty in remembering drug dose and timings and economic constraints in continuing medical treatment were statistically significant in nonadherent recipients. Although variation in the tacrolimus levels were significantly more common in the nonadherent group, acute cellular rejection and infection were not statistically different. The prevalence of nonadherence was 16.5%. Determinants of nonadherence were DDLT, belief in alternative medications, high regimen complexity, poor knowledge about medications and cost issues with long-term medications.",valid
19800044,"Many studies have investigated mechanically induced bone formation in mice and rats by applying loads to the long bones, and measuring changes in periosteal cortical bone apposition rates. However, the results are difficult to compare among each other because the loading schemes are generally different. The purpose of the present study was to develop a theoretical framework for evaluating the mechanical stimulus based on the bone daily strain stimulus, which is a function of loading cycles and bone strains. The daily strain stimulus would act as a single unifying parameter for directly comparing data from existing in vivo experiments, and is applied here to twenty previous rat and mouse studies. To calculate the daily strain stimulus, we determined the periosteal daily strain stimulus necessary for bone maintenance (xi(peri,0)) and the strain-cycle weighting exponent (m). In the first approach, we applied data from Rubin and Lanyon's bone maintenance studies. We calculated xi(peri,0) to be 2793 microstrain/day, and m to be 4.5. In the second approach, we used Fritton et al. 's strain gage recordings to calculate xi(peri,0) to be 1496 microstrain/day, and used an m value of 11.88, equal to human bone compressive fatigue properties. Fatigue data provided physiological relevance, and was useful for applying an established remodeling theory to in vivo studies. For both approaches, xi(peri,0) was below the fracture level. We then analyzed the applied strains, cycles, and periosteal bone apposition rates from the previous studies. The range of daily strain stimuli calculated using the first approach was much larger than the range using the second approach (2793-17312 microstrain/day compared to 1496-7681 microstrain/day). None of the studies applied a daily strain stimulus above the complete fatigue failure level, but some studies applied loading that could result in major fatigue microdamage. Bone apposition rates generally increased with increasing daily strain stimulus, which was consistent with previous theoretical models. The results suggest that the daily strain stimulus may be a reasonable first approximation for predicting bone apposition rates in a consistent manner. The use of the daily strain stimulus may be helpful for improving the design of future bone loading studies.",valid

Nevertheless, the determinants of TV viewership ratings, especially in the Chinese market, which is a critical revenue stream for FIFA TV broadcasting, are still unsolved. Using a distributional regression, this study aimed to quantify the dynamics of viewership ratings for the FIFA World Cup 2022 in mainland China. The CCTV viewership ratings were modeled using 12 covariables related to Chinese TV consumer behavior. Given the data structure, a Logit Normal regression model was chosen to fit the location and dispersion parameters of viewership ratings to explanatory variables. In the fitted heteroscedastic model, the viewership ratings dynamics in mainland China were driven by the match kick-off time: Time- and team-sensitive strategies are proposed to aid in crafting uncertainty-suppressing business decisions for the FIFA World Cup 2026.

No language restrictions were applied. Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials involving skeletally mature patients with a fracture of the distal radius, which compared commonly applied conservative interventions for fracture fixation. These included the application of an external support (plaster cast or brace) and fracture manipulation. All trials, judged as fitting the selection criteria by both reviewers, were independently assessed by both reviewers for methodological quality. Data were extracted for anatomical, functional and clinical, including complications, outcomes. The trials were grouped into categories relating to manipulation of displaced fractures; use and extent, including forearm position, of immobilisation; use of braces; different casting materials and techniques; and duration of immobilisation. Although quantitative data from some trials are presented, the lack of good quality trials and trial heterogeneity inhibited pooling of results. Three trials were newly included in this update. In all, there are 36 trials, involving a total of 4114 mainly female and older patients, meeting the inclusion criteria for this review. Comprehensive details of the individual trials are provided in tabular form, and their results, grouped as indicated above, have been presented in text and analyses tables. The poor quality and heterogeneity in terms of patient characteristics, interventions compared and outcome measurement, of the included trials meant that no meta-analyses were undertaken. There remains insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine which methods of conservative treatment are the most appropriate for the more common types of distal radial fractures in adults. Therefore, at present, practitioners applying conservative management should use an accepted technique with which they are familiar, and which is cost-effective from the perspective of their provider unit. Patient preferences and circumstances, and the risk of complications should also be considered. Prioritising research questions to clarify the most appropriate conservative treatment for this common fracture is warranted.

This literature review aimed to examine evidence for interventions using the PAM to tailor care for patients with chronic conditions, including enablers and barriers to implementation, and the impact on quality of care. A scoping review methodology was used to identify literature reporting on PAM-tailored interventions. The Insignia Health website and Medline database were searched. Included papers were published in English from 2004 to 2017, from Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, included adult patients with chronic conditions, and a PAM-tailored intervention. Eligible full-text papers were assessed against the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted into tables and summarised to assess the key findings, recurring themes and differences across papers. Twenty-one papers describing the use of PAM-tailored interventions (n=21) were identified. Interventions included motivational interviewing, health coaching, self-management planning and risk profile assessment. The perceived value and function of the PAM held by organisations, clinicians and patients influenced implementation and use. Evidence for the impact of PAM-tailored interventions on quality of care was limited. The PAM is being used to tailor a range of interventions for patients with chronic conditions.

24436009,"Isolating the short-term storage component of working memory (WM) from the myriad of associated executive processes has been an enduring challenge. Recent efforts have identified patterns of activity in visual regions that contain information about items being held in WM. However, it remains unclear (1) whether these representations withstand intervening sensory input and (2) how communication between multimodal association cortex and the unimodal perceptual regions supporting WM representations is involved in WM storage. We present evidence that the features of a face held in WM are stored within face-processing regions, that these representations persist across subsequent sensory input, and that information about the match between sensory input and a memory representation is relayed forward from perceptual to prefrontal regions. Participants were presented with a series of probe faces and indicated whether each probe matched a target face held in WM. We parametrically varied the feature similarity between the probe and target faces. Activity within face-processing regions scaled linearly with the degree of feature similarity between the probe face and the features of the target face, suggesting that the features of the target face were stored in these regions. Furthermore, directed connectivity measures revealed that the direction of information flow that was optimal for performance was from sensory regions that stored the features of the target face to dorsal prefrontal regions, supporting the notion that sensory input is compared to representations stored within perceptual regions and is subsequently relayed forward. Together, these findings indicate that WM storage operations are carried out within perceptual cortex.",valid

The rumpshaker mouse has been shown to carry a point mutation in the PLP gene that uncouples a deleterious effect on CNS myelin assembly, which these mice exhibit, from oligodendrocyte degeneration and cell death, which they do not. The developmental importance of the P0 protein in PNS myelination has been dramatically demonstrated by the analysis of loss-of-function mutations engineered through the expression of antisense RNA and through the insertional inactivation of the P0 gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells and the generation of P0-deficient mice. The cloned promoter of the P0 gene has been shown to drive quantitative, Schwann cell-specific expression of heterologous genes in transgenic mice. The PMP22/gas3 gene, previously cloned from fibroblast cell lines, has been found to encode an axonally regulated Schwann cell protein that is assembled into PNS myelin.

The primary objective of this study was to assess the incidence of peptic ulcer bleeding patients who were resistant to intravenous omeprazole. The secondary objective was to evaluate the relationship between intragastric pH and rebleeding rate in studied patients after successful endoscopic therapy. Between Oct. 1996 and Aug. 1999, 88 bleeding peptic ulcer patients who had obtained initial hemostasis with endoscopic therapy were enrolled in this study.

28421468,"Preference for a larger-variable ""risky"" option over a smaller-reliable ""safe"" option often depends upon the likelihood that the risky option will deliver a sufficiently sized reward to have an equivalent or superior expected value. However, preference for the risky option has been shown to increase under conditions where informative stimuli signaling the outcome of a risky choice is included between the choice and the outcome and this risk-prone preference persists even when the risky option has a lower expected value than the alternative safe option. In the present study, rhesus macaques chose between a risky option and a safe option across two experimental phases to determine whether the outcome signal affected the degree of preference for the risky option. Overall, six out of seven macaques showed a greater preference for the risky option in the signaled condition than in the unsignaled condition. The macaques' risky choices were sensitive to the expected value of the risky option and the signaled condition produced a general increase in risky choices independently of the expected value of the risky outcome. Overall, these results are consistent with those obtained with other animals, and this may relate to a process where animals show a biased preference for ""good news.""

Aside from predicting a flexible window setting for each raw image, we statistically identify the top four window settings by calculating the mean and standard deviations for the entire dataset. Images are scaled on each of the top settings estimated by WEM and following lesion classifiers are subsequently trained. We study the effects of only using the flexible window, the single fixed window as either a known default window used by radiologists or an estimated mean value, and two different approaches to combine results from the top window settings to improve the detection of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) from brain CT images. Experimental results showed that using the top four window settings identified from the window estimator module and combining the results had the best performance.",valid

Scattered hepatocyte degeneration began at the edge of the periportal region and was detectable by electron microscopy within 30 minutes of administration of 60 mg/kg of cocaine, with conspicuous disorganization of the endoplasmic reticulum being one of the earliest changes. Significant elevations of plasma AST and ALT were observed 3 hours after cocaine administration and were sustained for 12 hours, at which time progressive hepatocyte damage had developed into a network of confluent necrosis at the periphery of the periportal region. The rapidity of organelle derangement and subsequent cell death, and absence of any effect on total cytochrome P-450 or FAD-mono-oxygenase levels, appear to distinguish this periportal lesion from previous reports of cocaine induced centrilobular necrosis in non-enzyme induced mice, suggesting that the two types of damage may develop by different mechanisms. The observation that periportal lesions commence at the periphery of the periportal area, progressing portalwards with increasing dose and time, offers an explanation for the previously conflicting reports of cocaine induced mid-zonal and/or periportal lesions in phenobarbitone treated mice.",valid

20847698,"The Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome is defined as congenital aplasia of müllerian ducts derived structures in females with a normal female chromosomal and gonadal sex. Most cases with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome are sporadic, although familial cases have been reported. The genetic basis of Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome is largely unknown and seems heterogeneous, and a small number of cases were found to have mutations in the WNT4 gene. The aim of this study was to identify possible recurrent submicroscopic imbalances in a cohort of familial and sporadic cases with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was used to screen the subtelomeric sequences of all chromosomes in 30 patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (sporadic, n = 27 and familial, n = 3). Segregation analysis and pyrosequencing were applied to validate the MLPA results in the informative family. Partial duplication of the Xpter pseudoautosomal region 1 containing the short stature homeobox (SHOX) gene was detected in five patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (familial, n = 3 and sporadic, n = 2) and not in 53 healthy controls. The duplications were not overlapping, and SHOX was never entirely duplicated. Haplotyping in the informative family revealed that SHOX gene duplication was inherited from the unaffected father and was absent in two healthy sisters. Partial duplication of SHOX gene is found in some cases with both familial and sporadic Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser type I syndrome.",valid
35165703,"The 10-year risk of recurrent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events in patients with established ASCVD can be estimated with the Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) risk score, and may help refine clinical management. To broaden generalizability across regions, we updated the existing tool (SMART2 risk score) and recalibrated it with regional incidence rates and assessed its performance in external populations. Individuals with coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, or abdominal aortic aneurysms were included from the Utrecht Cardiovascular Cohort-SMART cohort [n = 8355; 1706 ASCVD events during a median follow-up of 8.2 years (interquartile range 4.2-12.5)] to derive a 10-year risk prediction model for recurrent ASCVD events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or cardiovascular mortality) using a Fine and Gray competing risk-adjusted model. The model was recalibrated to four regions across Europe, and to Asia (excluding Japan), Japan, Australia, North America, and Latin America using contemporary cohort data from each target region. External validation used data from seven cohorts [Clinical Practice Research Datalink, SWEDEHEART, the international REduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) Registry, Estonian Biobank, Spanish Biomarkers in Acute Coronary Syndrome and Biomarkers in Acute Myocardial Infarction (BACS/BAMI), the Norwegian COgnitive Impairment After STroke, and Bialystok PLUS/Polaspire] and included 369 044 individuals with established ASCVD of whom 62 807 experienced an ASCVD event. C-statistics ranged from 0.605 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.547-0.664] in BACS/BAMI to 0.772 (95% CI 0.659-0.886) in REACH Europe high-risk region. The clinical utility of the model was demonstrated across a range of clinically relevant treatment thresholds for intensified treatment options. The SMART2 risk score provides an updated, validated tool for the prediction of recurrent ASCVD events in patients with established ASCVD across European and non-European populations. The use of this tool could allow for a more personalized approach to secondary prevention based upon quantitative rather than qualitative estimates of residual risk.",valid

36274434,"Angiostrongylus vasorum is a widely distributed cardiopulmonary parasite of canids in Europe. Clinical signs in dogs can be highly variable and diagnostically challenging. A correct and early diagnosis is hence indispensable to adequately manage affected patients. First-stage larvae (L1) are excreted in the faeces of definitive hosts and conventionally identified using the Baermann technique. Moreover, ELISAs for the detection of circulating antigen and specific antibodies have been presented. The current study aimed at i) quantitatively assessing larval migration in the Baermann funnel after 12 h and 24 h; ii) investigating the influence of sample storage at 4 °C over the course of three days on the number of detected L1; iii) evaluating potential associations of adult worm burdens with larval shedding in dogs and ELISA optical density (OD) values for circulating parasite antigen and specific antibodies. Faecal samples were obtained from naturally infected dogs (n = 21) and Baermann funnels were set up in duplicate over the course of four consecutive days (days 0-3) starting with the day of sample collection. Funnels were harvested on days 1-4 after 12 and 24 h, respectively, and the number of L1 per gram faeces (LPG) was determined. The LPG did not differ between larval harvest after 12 h from harvest after 24 h. Storage of faecal samples at 4 °C for two and three days entailed a considerable decrease in LPG. Adult worm burdens and larval excretion data from previous experiments demonstrated a correlation between worm burden and LPG. In contrast, no correlations between worm burden and the level of parasite antigen and specific antibody OD values, respectively, were identified. Thus, OD values of both antigen and antibody ELISA did not allow for conclusions on infection intensity reflected by the number of adult parasites. For the detection of L1 in faeces, 12 or 24 h of larval migration time was not discriminating for A. vasorum positivity. Thus, early processing of faecal samples is essential, since larval detection and hence sensitivity of the approach considerably decreased over the course of three days of storage. Therefore, the common recommendation to collect faecal samples for three consecutive days and to subsequently analyse them needs to be reconsidered. The results of this study can be readily translated into precise recommendations for daily practice to adequately assess A. vasorum infected dogs.",valid
8149827,"Close relationships between agriculture and many areas of human activity determine countless interlinkages with global issues of natural environment protection, human population increase, food supply, industry and world trade. This broad context promotes different perceptions of sustainable agriculture by different interest groups. Profitable diversification away from overproduction of basic commodities and satisfaction of environmental pressure groups are major preoccupations in developed countries. Elsewhere the main concerns is to maintain a trend of increasing production: food security with a future dimension. Achieving this depends essentially on protecting the agricultural resource base. Inputs and input substitution are important co-related issues but the core of sustainability is the avoidance of any attrition of the potential for future production; this demands that we guard soil, water sources, grazing lands and gene pools against loss and degradation. Though superficially biophysical or technical in nature, most problems of resource degradation and eroding potential are rooted in economic, social and political issues; few such problems will be solved unless the primacy of these issues is recognized and addressed. Sustainable agriculture will likely remain elusive until governments and other agencies accept it as arising only as the outcome of a synthesis of strategies on population, employment, economic planning, technical research and national investment.",valid

15582731,"Enteric neuronal plasticity is probably fundamental in order to withstand injury or changes in intestinal activity. The role of the neuropeptides in neuroprotection is still enigmatic. The expression of galanin and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the effects of the two peptides on survival of small intestinal porcine myenteric neurons cultured for 6 days were studied. Immunocytochemistry and cell counting were used to evaluate the numbers of surviving neurons and their expression of galanin and VIP. To reflect the in vivo situation, cryostat sections of porcine mid-jejunum were used. A concentration-dependent and marked increase in neuronal survival was noted when neurons were grown in the presence of VIP (10(-8)-10(-6) M), whereas addition of galanin (10(-8)-10(-6) M) slightly decreased neuronal survival. A dramatic increase in the proportions of myenteric neurons containing VIP or galanin immunoreactivity occurred during culturing. The presence of VIP further increased the number of galanin-expressing neurons. A majority of the galanin-immunoreactive neurons lacked VIP, while all VIP-immunoreactive neurons contained galanin. In conclusion, culturing porcine myenteric neurons in the presence of VIP increases, while the presence of galanin reduces, survival. Culturing significantly increased the proportion of neurons expressing VIP and/or galanin; the presence of VIP further increased the number of galanin-expressing neurons.",valid

In order to acquire enough cells, hUCMSCs have to be expanded ex vivo. However, it remains to be elucidated whether the characteristics of hUCMSCs are altered during ex vivo expansion. In the present study, the quality of hUCMSCs, which is important for successful therapeutic use, was systematically examined during hUCMSC expansion ex vivo. Morphologically, hUCMSCs exhibited no visible changes during culture. In addition, hUCMSCs retained their proliferative ability between passages 0-5. At the molecular level, the cells continued expressing the specific positive surface markers, CD29, CD73 and CD90, and did not express the negative surface markers, CD14, CD34 or CD45, during culture ex vivo. Furthermore, the hUCMSCs exhibited low immunogenicity, which was maintained when cultured for five passages. However, the immunological properties of hUCMSCs were altered at passage 10, at which the percentage of hUCMSCs expressing human leukocyte antigen‑I was significantly increased. Collectively, these results suggested that hUCMSCs used for cell-based therapies require obtaining from cells, which have been expanded for fewer than five passages.",valid

35427837,"To investigate whether and how global O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAcylation), a prevalent nutrient-sensitive post-translation modification, regulates odontogenic differentiation and mineralization in human dental pulp cells (hDPCs). First, immunostaining assays on sections of dental pulp tissue were performed to detect the distributions of O-GlcNAcylation and its exclusive enzyme set O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). Then global O-GlcNAcylation was determined by anti O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine (RL2) Western blot during odontogenesis of hDPCs. Further, inhibition or knockdown of OGT and OGA were achieved by specific inhibitors or siRNA in vitro, respectively. The odonto-induction effect of O-GlcNAcylation ex vivo was investigated by a subcutaneous transplantation experiment. Moreover, the O-GlcNAc modification of RAPTOR was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. Odontogenic differentiation assays also investigated the indispensable role of RAPTOR during enhanced global O-GlcNAcylation. The signals of O-GlcNAc became more enriched in the odontoblasts compared to pulp fibroblasts. During odontogenesis of hDPCs, global O-GlcNAcylation was significantly increased. An increase or decrease of O-GlcNAcylation significantly boosted or blunted odontogenic differentiation, respectively. The fluctuation of O-GlcNAcylation continuously impacted the downstream targets of mTORC1. Consistently, RAPTOR was modified by O-GlcNAcylation, which was necessary for inducing odontogenesis. Global O-GlcNAcylation participated in and affected the odontogenic differentiation of hDPCs, which was mediated by the mTORC1 pathway. Thus, targeting O-GlcNAcylation might be a potential therapeutic intervention for pulp repair and regeneration.",valid
1287232,"The clinical outcome for 1362 patients with active cancer managed on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is compared with that of 122 patients with radiation enteritis (""cured"" cancer) and 416 patients with Crohn's disease. This longitudinal clinical information was reported to the North American Home Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Registry (Oley Foundation/A.S.P.E.N. joint project) between 1985 and 1989. The data shows that the number of active cancer patients on this therapy is increasing 13% per year. The annual survival rate is 25% for patients with active cancer, as compared with 88% for patients with radiation enteritis and 95% for patients with Crohn's disease. Although 50% of all active cancer patients starting HPN are dead within 6 to 9 months, the prognosis is somewhat better in children, and 20% of these active cancer patients appear to do well, returning to full oral nutrition and experiencing complete rehabilitation. These are presumed to be patients with a potentially curable cancer requiring super-aggressive treatment, which causes temporary severe gastrointestinal dysfunction. Adult active cancer patients have the same rehospitalization rate for HPN complications (once per year) as radiation enteritis and Crohn's disease patients. However, their rehospitalization rate for non-HPN complications is four times higher. This article reviews the factors that may explain the growth of HPN in active cancer patients and discusses some of the unanswered clinical questions that urgently need to be addressed to more effectively determine the appropriateness or inappropriateness of HPN management in the active cancer setting.",valid
19009585,"Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data are often analysed by mixed-effects modelling techniques (also known as population analysis), which has become a standard tool in the pharmaceutical industries for drug development. The last 10 years has witnessed considerable interest in the application of experimental design theories to population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic experiments. Design of population pharmacokinetic experiments involves selection and a careful balance of a number of design factors. Optimal design theory uses prior information about the model and parameter estimates to optimize a function of the Fisher information matrix to obtain the best combination of the design factors. This paper provides a review of the different approaches that have been described in the literature for optimal design of population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic experiments. It describes options that are available and highlights some of the issues that could be of concern as regards practical application. It also discusses areas of application of optimal design theories in clinical pharmacology experiments. It is expected that as the awareness about the benefits of this approach increases, more people will embrace it and ultimately will lead to more efficient population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic experiments and can also help to reduce both cost and time during drug development.",valid
31419661,"Microplastic pollution in the environment has received growing attention worldwide. A major impediment for accurate measurements of microplastics in environmental matrixes is to extract the particles. The most commonly-used method for separation from soil or sediment is flotation in dense liquid based on the relatively low density of plastic particles. This study provides an improved and optimized process for extraction of microplastic particles by modifying the floatation technique and floatation solution. Microplastics in soils and sediments are extracted by adding 200 g dry soil or sediment sample to 1.3 L mix of the saturated NaCl and NaI solutions in a volume ratio of 1:1 and aerating for 40 s then filtering the supernatant. The accuracy and precision of the new approach is validated by recovery experiments using soil and sediment samples spiked with six common microplastic compounds: polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS) and expanded polystyrene (EPS), and comparison with the previous method. The optimized approach is further compared with the previous approach using the real soil and sediment samples.",valid
20443463,"In highly-conformal radiotherapy, due to the complexity of both beam configurations and dose distributions, traditional in vivo dosimetry is unpractical or even impossible. The ideal dosimeter would be implanted inside the planning treatment volume so that it can directly measure the total delivered dose during each fraction with no additional uncertainty due to calculation models. The aim of this work is to verify if implantable metal oxide semiconductors field effect transistors (MOSFETs) can achieve a sufficient degree of dosimetric accuracy when used inside extracranial targets undergoing radiotherapy treatments using the Cyberknife system. Based on the preliminary findings of this study, new prototypes for high dose fractionations were developed to reduce the time dependence for long treatment delivery times. These dosimeters were recently cleared and are marketed as DVS-HFT. Multiple measurements were performed using both Virtual Water and water phantoms to characterize implantable MOSFETs under the Cyberknife beams, and included the reference-dosimetry consistency, the dependence of the response on the collimator size, on the daily delivered dose, and the time irradiation modality. Finally a Cyberknife prostate treatment simulation using a body phantom was conducted, and both MOSFET and ionization readings were compared to Monte Carlo calculations. The feasibility analysis was conducted based on the ratios of the absorbed dose divided by the dose reading, named as ""further calibration factor"" (FCF). The average FCFs resulted to be 0.98 for the collimator dependence test, and about 1.00 for the reference-dosimetry test, the dose-dependence test, and the time-dependence test. The average FCF of the prostate treatment simulation test was 0.99. The obtained results are well within DVS specifications, that is, the factory calibration is still valid for such kind of treatments using the Cyberknife system, with no need of further calibration factors to be applied. The final accuracy of implantable MOSFETs when used for such kind of treatments was estimated to be within +/- 4%. Additional investigations using dose/fraction higher than 12 Gy, different beam configurations, and tracking systems could extend the present findings to other kind of treatments. MOSFET technology was proven to have high versatility in fast adaptation of existing detectors to new applications. It is plausible to expect a general feasibility of implantable MOSFET technology for in vivo dosimetry of the extracranial-targets treatments using the Cyberknife, provided each particular application will be validated by suitable both physical and clinical studies.",valid

We evaluate the performance of our method by applying it to a library of publicly-available two-dimensional (2D) images that were hand-labeled by experts. Our algorithm yields a substantial quantitative improvement over other methods for this benchmark. For example, our method achieves a decrease of 3.2 in the Hausdorff distance and an decrease of 1.8 per slice in the merged nuclei error.",valid
21989956,"A novel approach for the simulation of host-guest systems by systematically scanning the host molecule's orientations within the guest cavity is presented along with a thermodynamic strategy for determining preferential binding modes and corresponding optimal interaction energies between host and guest molecules. By way of example, the elution order of hexabromocyclododecane stereoisomers from high performance liquid chromatography separation on a permethylated β-cyclcodextrin stationary phase has been computed using classical molecular dynamics simulations with the explicit solvents water and acetonitrile. Comparison of estimated with experimental separation data reveals remarkable squared coefficients of correlation with R(2) = 0.87 and a very high correlation R(LOO2) = 0.72 using the leave-one-out cross-validation method and water as solvent. In particular, the approach presented shapes up as very robust in terms of the evaluated time range under consideration, reflecting well thermodynamic equilibria. These and further observations correlating with experimental results suggest the suitability of the underlying force fields and our multi-mode approach for the estimation of relative binding affinities for host-guest systems with unknown binding modes.",valid
23447448,"The sustainable production of industrial platform chemicals is one of the great challenges facing the biotechnology field. Ideally, fermentation feedstocks would rather rely on industrial waste streams than on food-based raw materials. Corynebacterium glutamicum was metabolically engineered to produce the bio-nylon precursor 1,5-diaminopentane from the hemicellulose sugar xylose. Comparison of a basic diaminopentane producer strain on xylose and glucose feedstocks revealed a 30% reduction in diaminopentane yield and productivity on the pentose sugar. The integration of in vivo and in silico metabolic flux analysis by (13) C and elementary modes identified bottlenecks in the pentose phosphate pathway and the tricarboxylic acid cycle that limited performance on xylose. By the integration of global transcriptome profiling, this could be specifically targeted to the tkt operon, genes that encode for fructose bisphosphatase (fbp) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (icd), and to genes involved in formation of lysine (lysE) and N-acetyl diaminopentane (act). This was used to create the C. glutamicum strain DAP-Xyl1 icd(GTG) Peftu fbp Psod tkt Δact ΔlysE. The novel producer, designated DAP-Xyl2, exhibited a 54% increase in product yield to 233 mmol mol(-1) and a 100% increase in productivity to 1 mmol g(-1) h(-1) on the xylose substrate. In a fed-batch process, the strain achieved 103 g L(-1) of diaminopentane from xylose with a product yield of 32%. Xylose utilization is currently one of the most relevant metabolic engineering subjects. In this regard, the current work is a milestone in industrial strain engineering of C. glutamicum.

A minimum was found about 10 hours after irradiation in the older rats and later (18 h) in the younger ones.

Autoradiographs showed that fewer cells entered the cycle and those synthesizing showed a depressed rate of synthesis. These findings are discussed in relation to induction of cell death.",valid
35146798,"PRAME (PReferentially expressed Antigen in MElanoma) is an antigen that shows marked overexpression in melanoma compared to normal skin melanocytes. PRAME immunohistochemistry has proven effective in distinguishing melanocytic nevi from melanoma, but it is unclear if it may be used to distinguish melanoma in situ from other benign pigmented lesions. In particular, differentiating from melanocytic hyperplasia in sun-damaged skin is sometimes clinically and histopathologically challenging. We hypothesized that PRAME staining of solar lentigo, sun-damaged skin, and melanoma in situ would aid in setting a threshold of positivity that could be useful in evaluating such conditions. We collected and stained typical examples of solar lentigo, melanoma in situ, and non-lesional sun-damaged skin by PRAME immunohistochemistry to assess a potential cutoff of PRAME positivity. Solar lentigo and non-lesional sun-damaged skin had 10 or fewer PRAME-positive cells per millimeter (mean 1.2), on the other hand melanoma in situ had at least 16 (mean 75.1). PRAME immunostaining appears sensitive and specific in the current series. This could be clinically useful for distinguishing melanoma in situ from benign melanocytic hyperplasia in sun-damaged skin. However, further studies are required to determine if 10 cells per millimeter is an acceptable threshold of positivity.",valid
8426849,"A sixfold difference in resistance to coccidia (Eimeria tenella) infection between a resistant and a susceptible line of Auburn White Leghorn chickens, derived by selective breeding, has been reported. The purpose of the following study was to determine whether the resistance or susceptibility phenomenon in the Auburn lines could be manifested in a homogeneous group of isolated host kidney cells that support E. tenella development in vitro but not normally in vivo. Propagation of the parasite in host cells in vitro eliminates humoral and cellular elements of immunity, and allows the study of host genetic influences at the cellular level. Differences in parasite development were examined between the two lines of cells in vitro after 48 and 96 h of incubation; time periods that reflect initial infection of the host cells by the parasite and the subsequent asexual development. Quantification of differences by liquid scintillation counting was based on parasite-specific incorporation of pyrimidines, specifically [3H]-uracil. The results supported previous findings that overall E. tenella development was significantly greater in the host cells from the susceptible line than in the cells from the resistant cultures at both time periods.",valid

Penises were excised from CRF rabbits 4 weeks after inducing uraemia. In an organ bath the strips from controls and CRF rabbit corpus cavernosum were pre-contracted with phenylephrine and increasing doses of adenosine and ATP added. In the pre-contracted rabbit cavernosal tissue the relaxations induced by adenosine and ATP were unchanged in CRF. The lack of any relaxant effect of adenosine or ATP on the relaxation of cavernosal smooth muscle in rabbits with CRF might be because the relaxant effects of these agents are endothelium-independent and the endothelial purinergic receptor density was unchanged in CRF.",valid
32364395,"Ischemic heart disease, especially myocardial infarction (MI), is the leading cause of death worldwide. Apoptotic mechanisms are thought to play a significant role in cardiomyocyte death after MI. Increased production of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in cardiomyocytes is a normal response to promote tolerance and to reduce cell damage. Hsp27 is considered to be a therapeutic option for the treatment of ischemic heart disease due to its protective effects on hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Despite its antiapoptotic effects, the lack of strategies to deliver Hsp27 to the heart tissue in vivo limits its clinical applicability. In this study, we utilized an antibody against the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, which is expressed immediately after ischemia/reperfusion in the heart of MI rats. To achieve cardiomyocyte-targeted Hsp27 delivery after ischemia/reperfusion, we employed the immunoglobulin-binding dimer ZZ, a modified domain of protein A, in conjunction with the AT1 receptor antibody. Using the AT1 receptor antibody, we achieved systemic delivery of ZZ-TAT-GFP fusion protein into the heart of MI rats. This approach enabled selective delivery of Hsp27 to cardiomyocytes, rescued cells from apoptosis, reduced the area of fibrosis, and improved cardiac function in the rat MI model, thus suggesting its applicability as a cardiomyocyte-targeted protein delivery system to inhibit apoptosis induced by ischemic injury.",valid
16969133,"When quiescent cells are stimulated to reenter the cell cycle, growth factors are required only until the restriction point in G(1) phase. After this point the cell no longer requires growth factors, proliferative signaling molecules, or even protein synthesis in order to initiate DNA synthesis, which starts several hours later. Consequently, understanding the molecular nature of the restriction point constitutes one of the major goals in studies of growth regulation. We recently demonstrated that p27Kip1 (p27) regulates passage through G(1) phase in actively proliferating cultures, and initiated these studies to determine if it is also involved in passage through the restriction point following stimulation of quiescent cells. In support of this suggestion, we found that passage through the restriction point requires mitogen-dependent suppression of the high p27 levels normally present in quiescent cells. Moreover, as the culture progresses to mid-G(1) phase, the proportion of cells that pass the restriction point is increased by artificial suppression of p27 levels, while this proportion is reduced by elevation of p27 levels. p27 performs this critical function by regulating the subsequent activating phosphorylation of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK)2, which we also show is necessary for and closely associated with the initiation of DNA synthesis. We conclude that the p27 expression level at mid-G(1) phase determines when a cell passes through the restriction point, and does so by regulating subsequent CDK2 activation.",valid

19686060,"Survival and growth of cellular grafts in tissue engineering (TE) are limited by the rate of oxygen (O(2)) and nutrient diffusion. As such, monitoring the levels of nutrients and O(2) available to the cells is essential to assess the physiology of the cells and to evaluate strategies aiming at improving nutrient availability. In this article, a reporter system containing the luciferase gene driven by a hypoxia responsive promoter was used to monitor cellular hypoxia in a TE context. We report that luciferase activity correlates with the O(2) tension in the cell culture medium. When transgenic cells were seeded onto scaffolds and implanted in immune-deficient mice subcutaneously, luciferase activity was detected. To validate the response to O(2) levels of this reporter system, we cultured transgenic cells on biomaterials in a flow perfusion bioreactor and observed that cells in the bioreactor displayed a drastically lower luciferase activity than conventional static culture, and that higher luciferase activity is observed in the interior of a tissue-engineered construct, illustrating the uneven O(2) distribution in three-dimensional constructs under conventional static culture. We conclude that this reporter system is a versatile tool to investigate cellular O(2) availability in TE both in vitro and in vivo.",valid

We surveyed the outline of PHN/OHN curricula, clinical practicum in OHN, and the skill achievement levels of students in OHN clinical practicum according to the ""Minimum Requirements in PHNs Education 2004"" (MR2004) developed by the Japan Association of PHN Educational Institutions. The data were analyzed using a t-test and Mann-Whitney U test. All statistical analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS ver. 21.0. In the analysis, we used data from the 80 respondent schools (response rate 34.2%). In 39 schools (48.1%), lectures related to a clinical practicum in OHN were offered as independent subjects in the school curriculum; of these 39, two schools (2.5%) offered OHN as multiple independent subjects. In 49 schools (60.5%), clinical practicum in OHN was designated as a part of PHN training. In colleges that had a clinical practicum in OHN, the number of lecture hours related to OHN was 9.7 ± 11.6 hours, which was more than that in colleges without such a practicum, although the difference was not significant. We compared the skill achievement levels between the groups where the number of days in the OHN clinical practicum was up to two and up to three or more. There was a tendency for the skill achievement level to be higher in the group with the greater number of days, with a significant difference in 16 of 19 items. We clarified that the PHN curriculum is offered with many variations in colleges, and that the lectures and clinical practicum in OHN are developed according to each college's policy. We observed the following tendency: the more days in the OHN clinical practicum, the higher the student's skill achievement level. These findings suggest that guaranteeing a certain number of days in a clinical practicum in OHN is important for realizing high-quality PHN training.",valid
19348010,"Hirsutellin (HtA) is intermediate in size between other ribotoxins and less specific microbial RNases, and thus offers a unique chance to determine the minimal structural requirements for activities unique to ribotoxins. Here, we have determined the structure of HtA by NMR methods. The structure consists of one alpha-helix, a helical turn and seven beta-strands that form an N-terminal hairpin and an anti-parallel beta-sheet, with a characteristic alpha + beta fold and a highly positive charged surface. Compared to its larger homolog alpha-sarcin, the N-terminal hairpin is shorter and less positively charged. The secondary structure elements are connected by large loops with root mean square deviation (rmsd) values > 1 A, suggesting some degree of intrinsically dynamic behavior. The active site architecture of HtA is unique among ribotoxins. Compared to alpha-sarcin, HtA has an aspartate group, D40, replacing a tyrosine, and the aromatic ring of F126, located in the leucine 'environment' close to the catalytic H113 in a similar arrangement to that found in RNase T1. This unique active site structure is discussed in terms of its novel electrostatic interactions to understand the efficient cytotoxic activity of HtA. The contributions of the N-terminal hairpin, loop 2 and loop 5 with regard to protein functionality, protein-protein and protein-ipid interactions, are also discussed. The truncation and reduced charge of the N-terminal hairpin in HtA may be compensated for by the extension and new orientation of its loop 5. This novel orientation of loop 5 re-establishes a positive charge on the side of the molecule that has been shown to be important for intermolecular interactions in ribotoxins.",valid

Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a form of phototherapy, involving the application of low-power monochromatic and coherent light to injuries and lesions to stimulate healing. 1 This therapy has been successfully used for pain attenuation and to induce wound healing in nonhealing defects. Changes in normal and wounded fibroblast cell morphology were evaluated by light microscopy. Cellular parameters evaluated cell proliferation, cell viability, and cytotoxicity while molecular parameters assessed the extent of DNA damage. The results clearly demonstrate that LLLT has an effect on normal and wounded(3) human skin fibroblasts. The parameters showed that doses of 0.5, 2.5, 5, and 10 J/cm2 were sufficient to produce measurable changes in fibroblast cells. A dose of 10 J/cm2 appeared to produce a significant amount of cellular and molecular damage, which could be an important consideration for other therapies, such as photodynamic therapy.",valid
25159149,"Cdc15p is known to contribute to cytokinesis in fission yeast; however, the protein is not required to assemble the contractile ring of actin and myosin, but it helps to anchor the ring to the plasma membrane. Cdc15p has a lipid-binding F-BAR domain, suggesting that it provides a physical link between the plasma membrane and contractile ring proteins. However, we find that a more important function of Cdc15p during cytokinesis is to help deliver a transmembrane enzyme, Bgs1p (also called Cps1p), from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane, where it appears to anchor the contractile ring. Bgs1p synthesizes the cell wall in the cleavage furrow, but its enzyme activity is not required to anchor the contractile ring. We estimate that ∼ 2,000 Bgs1p molecules are required to anchor the ring. Without Bgs1p anchors, contractile rings slide along the plasma membrane, a phenomenon that depends on an unconventional type II myosin called Myp2p.",valid

The isolation of facultative and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, fungi, and gram-positive cocci (except viridans streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis) almost always indicated true bacteremia, whereas the isolation of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacilli, including Clostridium species, often represented contamination. More than 99% of all episodes were detected when two samples of blood (a total of 30 ml) were cultured. The five most common isolates were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The incidence of septicemia was highest among medical patients and lowest among obstetric-gynecologic patients. Two-thirds of all episodes were nosocomial; S. aureus, enterococci, facultative gram-negative bacilli, and fungi were especially common nosocomial pathogens. The microorganisms isolated varied with the hospital service; polymicrobial episodes were especially common among surgical patients and transplant recipients. The most common sources of bacteremia were the respiratory, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tracts; however, the source was unknown in nearly one-third of episodes.

21796121,"Severe behavioural deficits in psychiatric diseases such as autism and schizophrenia have been hypothesized to arise from elevations in the cellular balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) within neural microcircuitry.

Elevation, but not reduction, of cellular E/I balance within the mouse medial prefrontal cortex was found to elicit a profound impairment in cellular information processing, associated with specific behavioural impairments and increased high-frequency power in the 30-80 Hz range, which have both been observed in clinical conditions in humans.

Due to its structural features, the complete excision of vascular anomalies on the vermilion is challenging, making it difficult to determine the appropriate treatment strategy. Thus, the authors analyzed the results of surgical treatment of vascular anomalies on the vermilion. The medical records of 38 patients with vascular anomalies on the vermilion who underwent surgery from 1995 to 2013 were analyzed. Nine of the cases had an involuted hemangioma, and 29 cases had a vascular malformation; of the vascular malformations, 13, 11, one, and four cases involved were capillary malformations (CMs), venous malformations (VMs), lymphatic malformations (LMs), and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), respectively. We investigated the surgical methods used to treat these patients, the quantity of surgical procedures, complications and instances of recurrence, and self-assessed satisfaction scores. A total of 50 operations were carried out: 28 horizontal partial excisions, eight vertical partial excisions, and 14 operations using other surgical methods. All cases of AVM underwent complete excision. Six cases experienced minor complications and one case of recurrence was observed. The overall average satisfaction score was 4.1 out of 5, while the satisfaction scores associated with each lesion type were 4.2 for hemangiomas, 3.9 for CMs, 4.2 for VMs, 5.0 for LMs, and 4.0 for AVMs. It is difficult to completely excise vascular anomalies that involve the vermilion.

31557959,"Current satellite remote sensing data still have some inevitable defects, such as a low observing frequency, high cost and dense cloud cover, which limit the rapid response to ground changes and many potential applications. However, passenger aircraft may be an alternative remote sensing platform in emergency response due to the high revisit rate, dense coverage and low cost. This paper introduces a volunteered passenger aircraft remote sensing method (VPARS) for emergency response. It uses the images captured by the passenger volunteers during flight. Based on computer vision algorithms and geocoding procedures, these images can be processed into a mosaic orthoimage for rapid ground disaster mapping. Notable, due to the relatively low flight latitude, small clouds can be easily removed by stacking multi-angle tilt images in the VPARS method. A case study on the 2019 Guangdong flood monitoring validates these advantages. The frequent aircraft revisit time, intensive flight coverage, multi-angle images and low cost of the VPARS make it a potential way to complement traditional remote sensing methods in emergency response.",valid
3651230,"In four experiments we reexamined the recent report by Labbe, Firl, Mufson, and Stein (1983) that fetal cortical tissue transplanted to an aspirative prefrontal cortical cavity in rats can ameliorate the learning impairments induced by the aspirative lesions. Healthy surviving grafts from young (E16) embryonic donors had no immediate effects on the rats' impairments in T-maze alternation, spatial navigation in the Morris swimming pool task, or locomotor activity, and they produced even greater impairments than the lesions alone when all three tests were conducted after longer (3-5 month) survival periods. Grafts taken from older (E21) donors did produce a short-lasting improvement in the T-maze alternation performance, replicating the previous report. However, this effect was not seen in the other two behavioral tests; the grafts survived poorly, and the beneficial effect was no longer apparent in the long-term tests. It is concluded that (a) functional benefits of embryonic cortical grafts are dependent on a precise combination of conditions rather than being a general phenomenon, and (b) the short-lasting recovery in delayed alternation performance is attributable to diffuse influences of the embryonic tissue on the lesioned host brain rather than to a reconnection of damaged circuitries.",valid
33019031,"With rapid advancement in wearable biosensor technology, systems capable of real time, continuous and ambulatory monitoring of vital signs are increasingly emerging and their use can potentially help improve patient outcome. Monitoring continuous body temperature offers insights into its trend, allows early detection of fever and is critical in several diseases and clinical conditions including septicemia, infectious disease and others. There is a complex interaction between physiological and ambient parameters including heart rate, respiratory rate, muscle rigors and shivers, diaphoresis, local humidity, clothing, body, skin and ambient temperatures among others. This article presents feasibility analysis of a wireless biosensor patch device called as VitalPatch in capturing this physio-ambient-thermodynamic interaction to determine core body temperature, and details comparative performance assessments using oral thermometer and ingestible pill as reference devices. Based on a study on a cohort of 30 subjects with reference oral temperature, the proposed method showed a bias of 0.1 ± 0.37 °C, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.29 ± 0.25 °C. Another cohort of 22 subjects with continuous core body temperature pill as reference showed a bias of 0.16 ± 0.38 °C and MAE of 0.42 ± 0.22 °C.Clinical Relevance- Non-invasive, continuous and real time body temperature monitoring can lead to earlier fever detection and provides remote patient monitoring that can result in improved patient and clinical outcome.",valid

Current qPCR-based methods used to quantify pre-miRNAs are not effective to discriminate between pre-miRNAs and their parental pri-miRNAs. Here, we developed the intramolecular ligation method (iLIME) to quantify and sequence pre-miRNAs specifically. This method utilizes T4 RNA ligase 1 to convert pre-miRNAs into circularized RNAs, allowing us to design PCR primers to quantify pre-miRNAs, but not their parental pri-miRNAs. In addition, the iLIME also enables us to sequence the ends of pre-miRNAs using next-generation sequencing. Therefore, this method offers a simple and effective way to quantify and sequence pre-miRNAs, so it will be highly beneficial for investigating pre-miRNAs when addressing research questions and medical applications.",valid

15804605,"Newly synthesized polypeptides entering the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) encounter a large array of molecular chaperones and folding factors that facilitate proper folding as well as assess folding status, retaining non-native proteins within the ER. Calnexin (CNX), an ER membrane protein, and its soluble homologue, calreticulin (CRT), are two important molecular chaperones that contribute to both processes. They are highly unusual chaperones in that they act as lectins, binding the Asn-linked oligosaccharides of newly synthesized glycoproteins, as well as recognizing the polypeptide segments of glycoproteins. Furthermore, they associate with ERp57, a thiol oxidoreductase, that is thought to enhance the oxidative folding of glycoproteins bound to CNX/CRT. These characteristics of CNX and CRT as well as their mode of action have been elucidated though the use of multiple in vitro and in vivo approaches. This chapter will focus on the description of a number of in vitro assays that have been used to characterize the lectin and ERp57-binding functions of CNX/CRT and also their abilities to act as molecular chaperones to suppress protein aggregation. In addition, we will describe insect and mammalian expression systems in which major histocompatibility complex class I molecules are used as model glycoprotein substrates for CNX and CRT.

We report the effects of poloxamer 407 (Pluronic F-127) on plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in rats. Poloxamer 407 injected into rats by intraperitoneal injection (dose = 1.5 gm/kg) resulted in sustained (greater than 96 hour) hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. A larger dose of poloxamer 407 was required to elevate plasma triglyceride relative to total cholesterol. Ingestion of commercial rat chow had a negligible effect on plasma cholesterol and triglycerides levels in control (no poloxamer injection) animals, but consumption of food by animals that received an intraperitoneal injection of poloxamer 407 (30% w/w) resulted in significantly (p < .05) greater elevations in plasma cholesterol and triglycerides than in fasted animals administered poloxamer 407. The route of poloxamer 407 administration, namely intramuscular vs. intraperitoneal injection, was observed to be a more important factor for poloxamer-induced elevations in plasma cholesterol than poloxamer-mediated elevations in plasma triglycerides. Our results also provide suggestive evidence that the mechanism responsible for the elevation of plasma cholesterol following intraperitoneal injection of a poloxamer 407 solution (30% w/w) to rats may be due to stimulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity in the liver by the poloxamer vehicle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",valid

3490743,"Recent technical and clinical advances in MR of the liver are reviewed with special reference to the role of MR as a primary screening technique for detection of space-occupying lesions, especially metastases. The major current problem in upper abdominal MR imaging is physiologic motions, and this appears to have been effectively solved by newly introduced pulse-sequence and timing-parameter strategies. Short-TR/TE spin-echo sequences with extensive signal averaging and heavy T1-weighting produce images with exceptional anatomic detail and liver-cancer contrast differences. With this sequence superior sensitivity for liver-cancer detection has been shown in quantitative signal-difference to noise comparisons with other pulse sequences and in clinical comparisons with CT. MR discovered 14% more individual metastases and 3% more patients with liver cancer than CT in a blinded comparative study of 142 patients undergoing both exams. MR also showed greater specificity (98%) than CT (91%) in distinguishing patients without liver metastases. Differentiation of hemangioma from metastases was possible with greater than 90% specificity by using heavily T2-weighted sequences. Use of a fast-scan, gradient-recalled echo technique can also produce good-quality, multislice, T1-weighted studies of the liver in 20 sec--a breath-hold. MR contrast agents (such as gadolinium-DTPA and reticuloendothelial-system-specific, superparamagnetic ferrite-iron-oxide particles) offer further promise for enhanced sensitivity for liver-cancer detection. When optimal pulse sequences are employed, MR can now be appropriate as a primary screening method for detecting liver neoplasms.",valid
32165236,"Recent evidence has demonstrated that the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene are abnormally active in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and this change is crucial for the tumor survival and chemotherapy-resistant. Certain preclinical pharmacology studies have focused on STAT3 phosphorylation and homodimerization, and have developed a class of salicylic acid-based inhibitors, which blocks the nuclear translocation-dependent canonical STAT3 signaling. In the present study, we demonstrated that the salicylic acid-based compound SH-4-54 was quite toxic to temozolomide (TMZ)-resistant GBM cells and could trigger apoptosis in these cells via enhancing mitochondrial translocation-dependent non-canonical STAT3 pathway. We demonstrated that incubation of TMZ-resistant GBM cells with SH-4-54 led to mitochondrial STAT3 (mitoSTAT3) activation and respiratory dysfunction reflected by disrupted (or suppressed) activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes and oxygen consumption rate. Mechanistically, we proved that SH-4-54 could increase mitoSTAT3 transmembrane import via GRIM-19 and reinforce the association between mitoSTAT3 and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), indicating that SH-4-54 could facilitate the binding of mitoSTAT3 to mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) and negatively regulate mitochondrial-encoded genes, thus leading to the abnormal oxidation respiratory. Lastly, using GRIM-19 knockout cell line and subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model, we elaborately showed the enrichment of SH-4-54 in mitochondria by LC-MS/MS analysis. In conclusion, our data demonstrate thatthe salicylic acid-based compound SH-4-54 is quite effective in killing TMZ-resistant GBM cells and this cytotoxicity is attributed to mitoSTAT3 activation.",valid

This study sought to use the decision curve analysis (DCA), a novel approach to determine the impact of genetic profiling on fracture risk prediction. The study involved 2188 women and 1324 men, aged 60 years and above, who were followed for up to 23 years. Bone mineral density (BMD) and clinical risk factors were obtained at baseline. The incidence of fracture and mortality were recorded. A weighted individual genetic risk score (GRS) was constructed from 62 BMD-associated genetic variants. Four models were considered: CRF (clinical risk factors); CRF + GRS; Garvan model (GFRC) including CRF and femoral neck BMD; and GFRC + GRS. The DCA was used to evaluate the clinical net benefit of predictive models at a range of clinically reasonable risk thresholds. In both women and men, the full model GFRC + GRS achieved the highest net benefits. For 10-year risk threshold > 18% for women and > 15% for men, the GRS provided net benefit above those of the CRF models. At 20% risk threshold, adding the GRS could help to avoid 1 additional treatment per 81 women or 1 per 24 men compared with the Garvan model. At lower risk thresholds, there was no significant difference between the four models. The addition of genetic profiling into the clinical risk factors can improve the net clinical benefit at higher risk thresholds of fracture. Although the contribution of genetic profiling was modest in the presence of BMD + CRF, it appeared to be able to replace BMD for fracture prediction.",valid
18475068,"Much clinical research on laryngeal airflow has assumed that airflow is unidirectional. This review will summarize what additional knowledge can be obtained about vocal fold vibration and voice production by studying rotational motion, or vortices, in laryngeal airflow. Recent work suggests two types of vortices that may strongly contribute to voice quality. The first kind forms just above the vocal folds during glottal closing, and is formed by flow separation in the glottis; these flow separation vortices significantly contribute to rapid closing of the glottis, and hence, to producing loudness and high frequency harmonics in the acoustic spectrum. The second is a group of highly three-dimensional and coherent supraglottal vortices, which can produce sound by interaction with structures in the vocal tract. Present work is also described that suggests that certain laryngeal pathologies, such as asymmetric vocal fold tension, will significantly modify both types of vortices, with adverse impact on sound production: decreased rate of glottal closure, increased broadband noise, and a decreased signal to noise ratio. Recent research supports the hypothesis that glottal airflow contains certain vortical structures that significantly contribute to voice quality.",valid

However, implementing this strategy was problematic. We aimed for large-scale implementation of an adapted strategy covering both test ordering and prescribing performance. Because we failed to achieve large-scale implementation, the aim of this study was to describe and analyse the challenges of the transferring process. In a qualitative study 19 regional health officers, pharmacists, laboratory specialists and general practitioners were interviewed within 6 months after the transfer period. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and independently coded by two of the authors. The codes were matched to the dimensions of the normalization process theory. The general idea of the strategy was widely supported, but generating the feedback was more complex than expected and the need for external support after transfer of the strategy remained high because participants did not assume responsibility for the work and the distribution of resources that came with it. Evidence on effectiveness, a national infrastructure for these collaboratives and a general positive attitude were not sufficient for normalization. Thinking about managing large databases, responsibility for tasks and distribution of resources should start as early as possible when planning complex quality improvement strategies. Merely exploring the barriers and facilitators experienced in a preceding trial is not sufficient. Although multifaceted implementation strategies to change professional behaviour are attractive, their inherent complexity is also a pitfall for large-scale implementation.",valid
19140987,"Habitat loss and fragmentation are the leading causes of species' declines and extinctions. A key component of studying population response to habitat alteration is to understand how fragmentation affects population connectivity in disturbed landscapes. We used landscape genetic analyses to determine how habitat fragmentation due to timber harvest affects genetic population connectivity of the coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei), a forest-dwelling, stream-breeding amphibian. We compared rates of gene flow across old-growth (Olympic National Park) and logged landscapes (Olympic National Forest) and used spatial autoregression to estimate the effect of landscape variables on genetic structure. We detected higher overall genetic connectivity across the managed forest, although this was likely a historical signature of continuous forest before timber harvest began. Gene flow also occurred terrestrially, as connectivity was high across unconnected river basins. Autoregressive models demonstrated that closed forest and low solar radiation were correlated with increased gene flow. In addition, there was evidence for a temporal lag in the correlation of decreased gene flow with harvest, suggesting that the full genetic impact may not appear for several generations. Furthermore, we detected genetic evidence of population bottlenecks across the Olympic National Forest, including at sites that were within old-growth forest but surrounded by harvested patches. Collectively, this research suggests that absence of forest (whether due to natural or anthropogenic changes) is a key restrictor of genetic connectivity and that intact forested patches in the surrounding environment are necessary for continued gene flow and population connectivity.",valid

Adult patients with subluxated intraocular lenses that underwent iris-suture fixation between January 2000 and December 2014 by a single surgeon. Pregnant women, children (below the age of 18) and cases with follow-up under 1 month were excluded. Prediction error was calculated in 60 eyes and survival analysis was performed on 99 eyes. Prediction error (the difference between the postoperative manifest refraction in spherical equivalent and the spherical equivalent predicted by the Barrett Universal II, Holladay 2 and SRK/T formulas), preoperative and postoperative distance-corrected visual acuity, manifest refraction, frequency of postoperative complications and time until re-subluxation. Mean prediction error using the Barrett formula was -0.35 ± 1.0 D. Higher axial length (≥25.5 mm) was associated with greater prediction error (-0.72 ± 1.11 D vs -0.18 ± 0.91 D, P = .048). Twelve re-subluxations occurred over a mean follow-up period of 30.28 ± 41.86 months. The predicted 50% survival of iris-sutured lenses was 114.25 months.

Probabilistic linkage was used to identify women with repeat notifications in the same period. The risk of repeat notification was examined according to age and other characteristics using proportional hazards regression. Among 40 936 women in the cohort, 3236 had at least one repeat chlamydia notification over an average of 3.5 years of follow-up. The incidence of repeat notification was greatest in the first year after index notification (4.5 per 100 person-years) and decreased thereafter. The RR of repeat notification increased by 8% (95% CI 7% to 9%) for each year decrease in age. Compared with women aged 20-21 years at index chlamydia notification, women aged <16 years were twice as likely to have a repeat notification (adjusted HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.75 to 2.56), while women aged 26-27 years were half as likely (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.66). Year of index notification, parity and concurrent or past gonorrhoeal infection were also significantly associated with the risk of repeat notification, but socioeconomic status and area of residence were not.

Thirty samples were randomly selected from a large group of cervical cell samples suspended in a commercial coagulant fixative ""(BoonFix)."" PCR was used to amplify DNA of five bacterial species: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Mycoplasma hominis. The LBC slides were then analyzed by light microscopy to estimate bacterial adhesion. DNA of lactobacilli was detected in all cell samples. Seventeen smears showed colonization with Gardnerella vaginalis (range 2.6 x 10(2)-3.0 x 10(5) bacteria/mul BoonFix sample). Two cases were identified as dysbacteriotic with high DNA values for Gardnerella vaginalis and low values for Lactobacillus crispatus. The sample with the highest concentration for Gardnerella vaginalis showed an unequivocal Gardnerella infection. This study indicates that the adherence pattern of a disturbed flora in liquid-based cervical samples can be identified unequivocally, and that these samples are suitable for quantitative PCR analysis. This cultivation independent method reveals a strong inverse relationship between Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus crispatus in dysbacteriosis and unequivocal Gardnerella infection.",valid
17981780,"Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), members of the Dependovirus genus of the subfamily Parvovirinae, family Parvoviridae, have single-stranded DNA genomes that replicate via a double-stranded DNA intermediate which serves as the transcription template. They exhibit a highly compact, overlapping genetic organization which is surprisingly variable amongst various members within the group. Additionally, recent work has shown them to be excellent models for understanding potential interactions between alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, the export of unspliced RNAs, and transactivating proteins that influence RNA processing co-transcriptionally via interaction with the transcription template.",valid
19837191,"Magnesium (Mg) alloys are promising materials for the development of biodegradable implants. However, the current in vitro test procedures for cytotoxicity, cell viability and proliferation are not always suitable for this class of materials. In this paper we show that tetrazolium-salt-based assays, which are widely used in practice, are influenced by the corrosion products of Mg-based alloys. Corroded Mg converts tetrazolium salts to formazan, leading to a higher background and falsifying the results of cell viability. Tetrazolium-based assays are therefore not a useful tool for testing the cytotoxicity of Mg in static in vitro assays.",valid
37813167,"Amongst other molecules, the cholinergic system consists of choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT, - synthesis enzyme), acetylcholinesterase (AChE - primary hydrolysis enzyme), and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE - secondary hydrolysis enzyme). In the brainstem, the Dorsal Motor Nucleus of The Vagus (DMNV) has high cholinergic expression and is a region of interest in the neuropathology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is the unexpected death of a seemingly healthy infant, but postmortem brainstem abnormalities suggesting altered cholinergic regulation have been found. This study aimed to determine the percentage of positive ChAT and AChE neurons within the infant DMNV through immunohistochemistry at the three levels of the brainstem medulla (caudal, intermediate, and rostral), to investigate whether the proportion of neurons positive for these enzymes differs amongst the diagnostic subgroups of SIDS compared to those with an explained cause of Sudden unexpected death in infancy (eSUDI), and whether there were any associations with SIDS risk factors (male gender, cigarette smoke exposure, co-sleeping/bed sharing, and prone sleeping). Results showed that ChAT-positive neurons were lower in the rostral DMNV in the SIDS II cohort, and within the caudal and intermediate DMNV of infants who were exposed to cigarette smoke. These findings suggest altered cholinergic regulation in the brainstem of SIDS infants, with potential contribution of cigarette smoke exposure, presumably via the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor system.",valid
10187876,"Diagnostic imaging in hyperacute ischemic stroke has been revolutionized by the introduction of diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI (DWI and PWI). CT, however, is still needed to exclude intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The purpose of our study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of a standardized, multimodal MRI (mMRI) stroke protocol in the qualitative and quantitative assessment of hyperacute ICH (<6 hours). We investigated 9 patients with hyperacute ICH with CT followed immediately by a standardized mMRI stroke protocol (DWI, PWI [T2*-WI], FLAIR, T2-WI, and MRA). The time interval between MRI and symptom onset ranged from 3 hours to 5 hours 45 minutes. We analyzed and compared the size of the hematoma on CT and all mMRI images by semiautomatic volumetry. ICH was unambiguously identified on the basis of all mMRI sequences. With increasing susceptibility effect (T2*-WI), the ICH, appearing as an area of hyperintensity with central signal loss, became qualitatively most evident. Regarding quantitation, T2*-WI overestimated (median and mean difference, 18.9%/17.8%; SD final sigma=24.4%) and DWI correlated best (median and mean difference, 3.97%/-4.36%; SD final sigma=37. 42%) with hematoma size on CT. Multimodal stroke MRI is as reliable as CT in the assessment of hyperacute ICH. Therefore, additional CT is no longer necessary to rule out ICH in hyperacute stroke. The use of mMRI alone in the diagnostic workup of a hyperacute stroke patient saves time and costs while rendering all the critical information needed to initiate an optimal treatment.",valid
16450563,"An exploratory and descriptive study to obtain basic data on the extent, nature, sources and severity of injuries sustained on fruit farms was conducted. The possibility of utilizing lay health workers (LHWs) on farms to document routine information on injuries was also investigated. Descriptive information of all injuries occurring on selected farms, both occupational and other, needing some form of treatment, were documented over a one-year period from June 1999 to May 2000. A purposive non-probability sampling method was used. Forty-eight fruit farms with a history of trained LHWs were purposefully selected. Injuries were documented using a one-page questionnaire. A total of 500 injuries were recorded, giving an average of 10.4 injuries per farm per year. Half of these injuries were work-related. Workers aged 20-39 were most at risk. Injuries sustained were related to routine activities of fruit farming, occurred mostly in the orchards and involved cuts, bruises and abrasions to the hands, including the fingers, and the eyes. Most of the non-work related injuries occurred in and around the home. A third of these injuries were sustained by persons < 20. A large percentage of the non-work related injuries were violence- and alcohol related. Most of the injuries required basic primary health care that could be managed by the LHW. Injury severity caused people to take time off for one third of the cases. A relatively high occupational injury rate in comparison to high-income countries. Occupational Health and Safety legislation needs to be institutionalized and adhered to. Alcohol and violence on farms is a serious public health problem. LHWs could potentially play an important role in documenting injury data.",valid
28134287,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) are defined by their dual ability to self-renew through mitotic cell division or differentiate into the varied neural cell types of the CNS. DISP3/PTCHD2 is a sterol-sensing domain-containing protein, highly expressed in neural tissues, whose expression is regulated by thyroid hormone. In the present study, we used a mouse NSC line to investigate what effect DISP3 may have on the self-renewal and/or differentiation potential of the cells. We demonstrated that NSC differentiation triggered significant reduction in DISP3 expression in the resulting astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes. Moreover, when DISP3 expression was disrupted, the NSC ""stemness"" was suppressed, leading to a larger population of cells undergoing spontaneous neuronal differentiation. Conversely, overexpression of DISP3 resulted in increased NSC proliferation. When NSCs were cultured under differentiation conditions, we observed that the lack of DISP3 augmented the number of NSCs differentiating into each of the neural cell lineages and that neuronal morphology was altered. In contrast, DISP3 overexpression resulted in impaired cell differentiation. Taken together, our findings imply that DISP3 may help dictate the NSC cell fate to either undergo self-renewal or switch to the terminal differentiation cell program.",valid
8877728,"We investigated the prevalence of mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) in 100 cases of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and the effect of a 6-month treatment with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). Cryoglobulins were detected on admission in 36 of 100 patients and appeared during observation in a further 18 cases. Cryocrit ranged from 0.5% to 20%. Patients with MC were older and had a higher incidence of cirrhosis than those without MC. Immunologic characterization of the cryoprecipitate showed the presence of type II in 84% of cases and type III in 16%. The patients received IFN-alpha (6 MU three times per week) for 6 months. Fifty-seven were responders (i.e., reached normal aminotransferase levels), 26 of these relapsed within 2 months after IFN withdrawal, and 30 did not relapse. After IFN-alpha treatment, cryoglobulinemia disappeared in 11 of the 21 evaluable responders, but in none of the 15 nonresponder patients (p < 0.003). The clearance of MC was associated in all cases with clearance of HCV RNA. The delayed appearance of cryoglobulinemia in responders seems to be associated with a higher probability of relapse.",valid
28914647,"Caudal anesthesia has been used for postoperative pain control in pediatric surgical patients, but the duration of the analgesic effect is occasionally unsatisfactory. Intravenous steroids have been shown to be effective for postsurgical pain management after certain surgeries. The aim of this meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis (TSA) was to evaluate the analgesic effect of steroids in patients administered with caudal anesthesia. This study was a systematic review and meta-analysis. A search of published literature was conducted in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases and in trial registration sites. Randomized controlled trials that compared intravenous steroids with a placebo in pediatric patients who had received caudal anesthesia for surgery were included in the study. The primary outcomes from the present meta-analysis were the analgesic duration and the number of patients who required rescue analgesics. The analgesic duration and incidence of rescue use were summarized using mean difference or risk ratio with a 97.5% confidence interval (CI), respectively. If the 97.5% CI of the mean difference or risk ratio included a value of 0 or 1, respectively, we considered the difference not to be significant. We used the random effects model to combine the results. Heterogeneity was quantified with the I statistic. The quality of the trials was evaluated using the Cochrane methodology. Moreover, a TSA with a risk of type 1 error of 2.5% and power of 90% was performed. We established the minimum clinically meaningful difference of analgesic duration as 3 hours. The target sample size for meta-analysis was also calculated in the TSA. We also assessed adverse events. Six trials with 424 patients were included; 211 patients received intravenous steroids. All trials compared dexamethasone of at least 0.5 mg/kg dose with a placebo. Dexamethasone prolonged the duration of caudal analgesia (mean difference, 244 minutes; 97.5% CI, 188-300). Heterogeneity was considerable with an I value of 94.8%. Quality of evidence was very low. The TSA suggested that only 17.0% of the target sample size had been reached, but the cumulative Z score crossed the trial sequential monitoring boundary to indicate a benefit. Rescue use was reported in 4 studies with 260 patients. Rescue use was not significantly reduced in the dexamethasone group (risk ratio, 0.53; 97.5% CI, 0.09-3.30; I, 98.7%). No increase in adverse events was reported. Intravenous dexamethasone prolongs the analgesic duration of caudal anesthesia. Trials to investigate the effectiveness of a lower dose of the dexamethasone in prolonging analgesic effects would be of interest. Further trials with a low risk of bias are necessary.",valid
9162585,"To study the possibility that schistosomiasis might be able to spread into the basins of the Paraná and Uruguay rivers, 1,711 snails were experimentally exposed to infection with Schistosoma mansoni. These snails were laboratory-bred progeny of Biomphalaria tenagophila collected from 15 populations in the geographic area under consideration. Three strains of S. mansoni were used: BH2, adapted to B. glabrata, and SJ and SJ2 adapted to B. tenagophila. None of the 543 snails exposed to the BH2 strain became infected, nor did any of the 668 exposed to SJ. However, of the 500 exposed the SJ2, 4 of the 163 snails (2%) from Ayolas, a locality in the Paraná basin, were susceptible, as were 8 of 45 (18%) from Fuente, Salto, in the Uruguay basin. These findings are similar to those of studies done in other geographic areas, where some populations of B. tenagophila do not become infected with S. mansoni while others are susceptible. The results of this study signal the possibility of the expansion of schistosomiasis into a broad region of South America in which B. tenagophila is found.",valid
24850902,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) arises at the convergence of genetic alterations in KRAS with a fostering microenvironment shaped by immune cell influx and fibrotic changes; identification of the earliest tumorigenic molecular mediators evokes the proverbial chicken and egg problem. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are key drivers of tumor progression that originate primarily from stromal cells activated by the developing tumor. Here, MMP3, known to be expressed in PDA, was found to be associated with expression of Rac1b, a tumorigenic splice isoform of Rac1, in all stages of pancreatic cancer. Using a large cohort of human PDA tissue biopsies specimens, both MMP3 and Rac1b are expressed in PDA cells, that the expression levels of the two markers are highly correlated, and that the subcellular distribution of Rac1b in PDA is significantly associated with patient outcome. Using transgenic mouse models, coexpression of MMP3 with activated KRAS in pancreatic acinar cells stimulates metaplasia and immune cell infiltration, priming the stromal microenvironment for early tumor development. Finally, exposure of cultured pancreatic cancer cells to recombinant MMP3 stimulates expression of Rac1b, increases cellular invasiveness, and activation of tumorigenic transcriptional profiles. MMP3 acts as a coconspirator of oncogenic KRAS in pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis and progression, both through Rac1b-mediated phenotypic control of pancreatic cancer cells themselves, and by giving rise to the tumorigenic microenvironment; these findings also point to inhibition of this pathway as a potential therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer.",valid
17346684,"Evidence suggests that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) is a leading cause of dopaminergic neuronal cell death. TNF also, however, has neuroprotective effects. Thus, TNF might have a dual role following injury: immediate release after injury is protective, whereas chronic increases are detrimental. In the present study, 6-hydroxydopamine was used to lesion the dorsal striatum in male Fisher 344 rats at 2 different time points. Group 1 received a daily injection of TNFalpha antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ODN) or control on days 1 through 7 post-lesion. Group 2 received a daily injection of TNF antisense ODN or control on days 5 through 15 post-lesion. Rats were killed on the day following the last injection of TNF antisense ODN. Injection of TNF antisense ODN on days 1 through 7 increased the area of the tyrosine-hydroxylase-negative zone ipsilateral to the injection when compared to controls. In contrast, when inhibition of TNF was delayed, the area of tyrosine hydroxylase loss was significantly reduced. These findings suggest that TNF release is neuroprotective in the early stages of injury but becomes neurotoxic when chronically induced.",valid
20046765,"In the 1990s, drug resistance has become an important problem in a variety of infectious diseases including human immunodeficiency virus infection, tuberculosis, and other bacterial infections which have profound effects on human health. At the same time, there have been dramatic increase in the incidence of fungal infections, which are probably the result of alterations in immune status associated with the acquired immuno deficiency syndrome epidemic, cancer chemotherapy, and organ and bone marrow transplantation. The rise in the incidence of fungal infections has exacerbated the need for the next generation of antifungal agents, since many of the currently available drugs have undesirable side effects, are ineffective against new or reemerging fungi, or lead to the rapid development of the resistance. This review will focus on the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, since a large body of work on the factors and mechanism associated with antifungal drug resistance in this organism is reported sufficiently.

Our novel algorithm to calculate the volume of internal cavities within protein structures is used to demonstrate that, although the sizes of the cavities of the investigated PR-10 proteins vary significantly, their other physical properties, such as thermodynamic and mechanical parameters or parameters related to folding, are very close. The largest variations (in the order of 20%) are predicted for the optimal folding times. We show that, on squeezing, the PR-10 proteins behave differently from typical virus capsids.",valid

Homeowners were divided into protective and non-protective apparel groups and applied both a granular and liquid formulation of 2,4-D on two separate dates. Analyses of urine collected from homeowners for 96 hours following applications found total body doses ranging from non-detectable to 0.0071 mg/kg of body weight. The highest exposures occurred in the non-protected group and were consistently associated with spills of the liquid concentrate or excessive contact with the dilute mixture on the hands or forearms. Residues of 2,4-D were not detected in urine samples supplied by bystanders to home applicators. Residues of 2,4-D were detected in five of the 76 air samples taken during the home applications. Two of these air samples coincided with measurable applicator exposure but it is unlikely that this was a major route of exposure.",valid
28109669,"Schizophrenia displays connectivity deficits in the brain, but the literature has shown inconsistent findings about alterations in global efficiency of brain functional networks. We supposed that such inconsistency at the whole brain level may be due to a mixture of different portions of global efficiency at sub-brain levels. Accordingly, we considered measuring portions of global efficiency in two aspects: spatial portions by considering sub-brain networks and topological portions by considering contributions to global efficiency according to direct and indirect topological connections. We proposed adjacency and indirect adjacency as new network parameters attributable to direct and indirect topological connections, respectively, and applied them to graph-theoretical analysis of brain functional networks constructed from resting state fMRI data of 22 patients with schizophrenia and 22 healthy controls. Group differences in the network parameters were observed not for whole brain and hemispheric networks, but for regional networks. Alterations in adjacency and indirect adjacency were in opposite directions, such that adjacency increased, but indirect adjacency decreased in patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, over connections in frontal and parietal regions, increased adjacency was associated with more severe negative symptoms, while decreased adjacency was associated with more severe positive symptoms of schizophrenia. This finding indicates that connectivity deficits associated with positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia may involve topologically different paths in the brain. In patients with schizophrenia, although changes in global efficiency may not be clearly shown, different alterations in brain functional networks according to direct and indirect topological connections could be revealed at the regional level.",valid
11416901,"Primary tooth impaction is quite rare during the development of primary dentition. Various factors contribute to the impaction of a deciduous tooth, including malposition and malformation of the tooth bud, dentomaxillofacial disharmony, tumors, and cysts. This case was a 6-year-old female with complete left cleft lip/palate. A maxillary right second deciduous molar impacting at a high level approximate to the maxillary sinus was noted on the initial visit. To prevent surgical trauma to the surrounding tissue and succedaneous teeth, regular follow-up with radiographic examination was taken every 2 years. After a 7-year long-term follow-up, the impacted second primary molar in the right maxillary sinus had almost completely been resorbed with only about 10% of the original structure left. To the present, the resorption of the impacted deciduous molar seemed to have continued with no major pathological changes. Periodic radiographic examination is strongly advised until the total resorption process is completed.",valid

In this article, we examine nurses' perspectives on the implementation of Lean redesigns to the inpatient discharge process. We found that nurses experienced competing demands and tensions related to their time and professional roles and responsibilities as a result of Lean. Four main themes included (a) addressing the needs of individual patients, while still maintaining overall patient flow; (b) meeting discharge efficiency targets while also achieving high patient satisfaction scores; (c) ""wasting time"" to save time; and (d) the ""real"" work of providing clinical care versus the ""Lean"" work of process improvement. Our findings highlight the importance of soliciting hospital nurses' perspectives when implementing Lean process improvements to improve efficiency and patient flow.",valid

9708566,"The purpose of this article is to describe the methods used to determine the precise, patient-specific dose (in mCi) of 131I anti-B1 antibody needed to deliver a specified whole-body radiation dose (generally 75 cGy) to patients being treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The general principles, as well as simplified methods for dosimetry calculation, are described, and a ""worked"" example is provided. The approach described involves administration of a tracer dose that is used to determine the patient-specific whole-body residence time. The total-body radiation dose per unit of cumulated activity is calculated using an ellipsoid model of the human body, with an assumption of uniform distribution of radioactivity. Together, they determine the appropriate patient-specific therapeutic dose of radiolabeled antibody needed to deliver a specified total-body dose of radiation. Because a monoexponential whole-body effective half-time adequately describes the total-body kinetics, the patient's whole-body residence time is estimated from three whole-body radioactivity observations obtained over 6-7 days. Whole-body counts can be collected using either a thyroid probe system or a whole-body gamma camera. The residence time, in conjunction with the patient's weight, determines the desired therapeutic activity. Dose attenuations are instituted for obesity and reduced blood platelet counts. Methods for determining total-body dose of radiation, including a simplified dosimetric method based on just three data points, are described. Tables and graphs to allow such calculations are presented for radioimmunotherapy with 131I anti-B1 antibody, although they are likely to be useful in other forms of radiopharmaceutical therapy as well.",valid

32210509,"The increasing prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in developing countries has become a worldwide concern. This problem is preventable by timely diagnosis and treatment; however, in the majority of cases, patients attend the eye clinics very late because of a lack of specialists and travel difficulties. Running a teleophthalmology system would significantly help to manage this disease. This study seeks to assess the accuracy of the teleophthalmology system and its effect on reducing unnecessary referrals in Iran. This study was conducted on 125 diabetic patients. First, the patients were examined by a retina specialist using a slit lamp and, then, single-field digital photos were captured by a portable, low-cost fundus camera. The images were uploaded onto a website and, after two months, were assessed by two retina specialists and two general practitioners (GPs). Finally, the diagnoses based on the digital photos were contrasted with the diagnoses established through face-to-face visits as a gold standard. Out of 125 diabetic patients, eight (6.4%) were removed because of low-quality images and a total of 117 were evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of each retina specialist presented with the photographs produced success rates of 90% and 97% respectively when judged against the gold standard of face-to-face visits. The rates of sensitivity for retinopathy referrals from the retina specialists were 92% and 85%. The sensitivity and specificity of their diagnoses of clinically significant macular edema (CSME) were calculated at 93% and 100%. The rates of sensitivity for each GP were 95% and 93% and the level of specificity was estimated to be approximately 98% for both GPs. The diagnosis rate for GPs when viewing the photographs as opposed to hosting face-to-face visits was more than 90%. Generally, with the implementation of this system, between 40% and 55% of referrals were calculated to have been avoidable. Our results from the first-ever research conducted on this topic in Iran showed that the teleophthalmology system is extremely accurate, that it can prevent unnecessary referrals and that it is useful for locating treatable patients. The results of this study could be of assistance in the running and expansion of such systems throughout Iran and Kerman Province to reduce eye damage arising from diabetes, decrease avoidable referrals to clinics, increase the availability of specialist visits for people in remote and rural areas and optimize the use of clinical infrastructures for patients in emergencies.",valid

The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between PCOM and insulin resistance. This was a cross-sectional clinical study. A total of 679 women with PCOS who were diagnosed using the National Institute of Child Health and Human Disease (NICHD) criteria and 272 control women were analysed. We measured fasting glucose and insulin levels, 75 g oral glucose tolerance test-derived glucose and insulin levels, testosterone levels, ovarian volume and follicle number. Polycystic ovary morphology was described in 543 women (80.0%) with PCOS. Women with PCOS had significantly higher 2 hours postload glucose, fasting and 2 hours postload insulin levels, ovarian volume, ovarian follicle numbers and lower insulin sensitivity compared with those of the controls (all P<.01). In women with PCOS, ovarian volume and ovarian follicle number were negatively associated with the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index after adjusting for age, body mass index and total testosterone; however, this association was not observed in the controls. In the logistic regression analysis, increased ovarian follicle number was associated with decreased insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS. In PCOS, enlarged ovarian volume and follicle excess were associated with insulin resistance, and the number of ovarian follicles could be a predictor of insulin resistance.",valid

Compared with DP-DES, BP-DES showed lower LLL (in stent: weighted mean difference WMD -0.45 mm, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.24 mm, P = 0.00001; in segment: WMD -0.15 mm, 95% CI = -0.24 to -0.06 mm, P = 0.001) and lower rates of LST (OR 0.51, 95% CI = 0.30 to 0.86, P = 0.01), although they did not improve mortality, MI, TLR, and TVR rates. BP-DES coated with sirolimus or novolimus, in comparison with biolimus or paclitaxel, were associated with reduced LLL (P < 0.0001 for subgroups). In comparison with DP-DES, BP-DES significantly reduce LLL and LST rates, without clear benefits on harder endpoints. The efficacy of BP-DES in preserving lumen patency seems larger for sirolimus and novolimus DES.",valid

Inadvertent soft tissue extravasation resulted in erythema, subcutaneous calcification, tissue necrosis, skin slough, and transient radial nerve damage with wrist drop, the latter previously unreported. The soft tissue lesions may be mistaken for cellulitis, abscess, calcified hematoma, or osteomyelitis, resulting in unnecessary antibiotic therapy or surgical intervention. Initially, no clinical abnormality may be apparent. The lesions appear from days to weeks following extravasation. Radiographs are initially negative but soft calcification appears in one to three weeks. Follow-up x-ray films show complete resorption of the calcium over several months. Skin sloughs heal in four to six weeks without skin grafting. Extreme care in the parenteral use of calcium gluconate and conservative treatment of the complications is advocated.",valid
14871655,"Proteins that inhibit alpha-amylases have been isolated from plants and microorganisms. These inhibitors can have natural roles in the control of endogenous alpha-amylase activity or in defence against pathogens and pests; certain inhibitors are reported to be antinutritional factors. The alpha-amylase inhibitors belong to seven different protein structural families, most of which also contain evolutionary related proteins without inhibitory activity. Two families include bifunctional inhibitors acting both on alpha-amylases and proteases. High-resolution structures are available of target alpha-amylases in complex with inhibitors from five families. These structures indicate major diversity but also some similarity in the structural basis of alpha-amylase inhibition. Mutational analysis of the mechanism of inhibition was performed in a few cases and various protein engineering and biotechnological approaches have been outlined for exploitation of the inhibitory function.",valid

21846403,"Traditional assessment of drug-induced hepatotoxicity includes morphological examination of the liver and evaluation of liver enzyme activity in serum. The objective of the study was to determine the origin of drug-related elevation in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity in the absence of morphologic changes in the liver by utilizing molecular and immunohistochemical techniques. Sixteen female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 groups (control and treated, n = 4 per group) and treated rats were dosed orally twice daily (400 mg/kg/day) for 7 days with a VEGFR-2 compound (AG28262), which in a previous study caused ALT elevation without morphological changes. Serum of both treated and control animals were evaluated on day 3 of treatment and at day 8. Three separate liver lobes (caudate, right medial, and left lateral) were examined for determination of ALT tissue activity, ALT gene expression and morphological changes. ALT activity was significantly (p < 0.01) elevated on day 3 and further increased on day 8. Histologic changes or increase in TUNEL and caspase3 positive cells were not observed in the liver lobes examined. ALT gene expression in the caudate lobe was significantly up-regulated by 63%. ALT expression in the left lateral lobe was not significantly affected. Statistically significant increased liver ALT enzymatic activity occurred in the caudate (96%) and right medial (41%) lobes but not in the left lateral lobe. AG28262, a VEFG-r2 inhibitor, causes an increase in serum ALT, due in part to both gene up-regulation. Differences between liver lobes may be attributable to differential distribution of blood from portal circulation. Incorporation of molecular data, such as gene and protein expression, and sampling multiple liver lobes may shed mechanistic insight to the evaluation of hepatotoxicity.",valid

Injection of -amyloid peptide (A1-42) into the lateral ventricle was used to induce AD in rats. Rats in treatment groups received HCM (1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 g/kg) and Donepezil (0.92 mg/kg) for 21 days, respectively. The spatial learning and memory ability were observed by Morris water maze (MWM) test. Haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was carried out for pathological morphology. The contents of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the hippocampus were determined using the spectrophotometric method. A expression was measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Rats in HCM groups spent less time to locate the platform and performed better in spatial learning and memory than the AD group (p < 0.05). Hippocampus in the HCM (6.0 g/kg) group had a complete pyramidal cell layer, in which the structure of morphology was normal and the number of neurons was larger than in the AD group (p < 0.01). The contents of SOD, CAT, GSH-Px were notably increased and MDA content was significantly decreased in the hippocampus in HCM groups than in the AD group (p < 0.01). The expression levels of A1-42 in HCM groups were markedly decreased than in the AD group (p < 0.01). HCM has a protective effect on the learning and memory capacity in AD in rats, indicating that HCM had cognitive enhancing potentials on AD.",valid

23403987,"In this paper, we propose new methods for investigating the extent of heterogeneity in effective contact rates relevant to the transmission of infections. These methods exploit the correlations between ages at infection for different infections within individuals. The methods are developed for serological surveys, which provide accessible individual data on several infections, and are applied to a wide range of infections. We find that childhood infections are often highly correlated within individuals in early childhood, with the correlations persisting into adulthood only for infections sharing a transmission route. We discuss 2 applications of the methods: 1) to making inferences about routes of transmission when these are unknown or uncertain and 2) to estimating epidemiologic parameters such as the basic reproduction number and the critical immunization threshold. Two examples of such applications are presented: elucidating the transmission route of polyomaviruses BK and JC and estimating the basic reproduction number and critical immunization coverage of varicella-zoster infection in Belgium, Italy, Poland, and England and Wales. We speculate that childhood correlations stem from confounding of different transmission routes and represent heterogeneity in childhood circumstances, notably nursery-school attendance. In contrast, it is suggested that correlations in adulthood are route-specific.",valid

15689562,"Insulin receptor substrates (Irs-proteins) integrate signals from the insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) receptors with other processes to control cellular growth, function, and survival. Here, we show that Irs2 promoted the maturation and survival of photoreceptors in the murine retina immediately after birth. Irs2 was mainly localized to the outer plexiform layer as well as to photoreceptor inner segments. It was also seen in ganglion cells and inner plexiform layer but in smaller amounts. Compared with control littermates, Irs2 knock-out mice lose 10% of their photoreceptors 1 week after birth and up to 50% by 2 weeks of age as a result of increased apoptosis. The surviving photoreceptor cells developed short organized segments, which displayed proportionally diminished but otherwise normal electrical function. However, IGF1-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was barely detected, and cleaved/activated caspase-3 was significantly elevated in isolated retinas of Irs2-/- mice. When diabetes was prevented, which allowed the Irs2-/- mice to survive for 2 years, most photoreceptor cells were lost by 16 months of age. Because apoptosis is the final common pathway in photoreceptor degeneration, pharmacological strategies that increase Irs2 expression or function in photoreceptor cells could be a general treatment for blinding diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa.",valid
20876566,"Aneuploid cells are characterized by incomplete chromosome sets. The resulting imbalance in gene dosage has phenotypic consequences that are specific to each karyotype. Even in the case of Down syndrome, the most viable and studied form of human aneuploidy, the mechanisms underlying the connected phenotypes remain mostly unclear. Because of their tolerance to aneuploidy, plants provide a powerful system for a genome-wide investigation of aneuploid syndromes, an approach that is not feasible in animal systems. Indeed, in many plant species, populations of aneuploid individuals can be easily obtained from triploid individuals. We phenotyped a population of Arabidopsis thaliana aneuploid individuals containing 25 different karyotypes. Even in this highly heterogeneous population, we demonstrate that certain traits are strongly associated with the dosage of specific chromosome types and that chromosomal effects can be additive. Further, we identified subtle developmental phenotypes expressed in the diploid progeny of aneuploid parent(s) but not in euploid controls from diploid lineages. These results indicate long-term phenotypic consequences of aneuploidy that can persist after chromosomal balance has been restored. We verified the diploid nature of these individuals by whole-genome sequencing and discuss the possibility that trans-generational phenotypic effects stem from epigenetic modifications passed from aneuploid parents to their diploid progeny.",valid

Expressing the OR in vitro reproduced the antagonism reported for short odor pulses, but not for prolonged odor exposure.

22617133,"Skin metastases occur in 0.6%-10.4% of all patients with cancer and represent 2% of all skin tumors. Skin metastases from visceral malignancies are important for dermatologists and dermatopathologists because of their variable clinical appearance and presentation, frequent delay and failure in their diagnosis, relative proportion of different internal malignancies metastasizing to the skin, and impact on morbidity, prognosis, and treatment. Another factor to take into account is that cutaneous metastasis may be the first sign of clinically silent visceral cancer. The relative frequencies of metastatic skin disease tend to correlate with the frequency of the different types of primary cancer in each sex. Thus, women with skin metastases have the following distribution in decreasing order of frequency of primary malignancies: breast, ovary, oral cavity, lung, and large intestine. In men, the distribution is as follows: lung, large intestine, oral cavity, kidney, breast, esophagus, pancreas, stomach, and liver. A wide morphologic spectrum of clinical appearances has been described in cutaneous metastases. This variable clinical morphology included nodules, papules, plaques, tumors, and ulcers. From a histopathologic point of view, there are 4 main morphologic patterns of cutaneous metastases involving the dermis, namely, nodular, infiltrative, diffuse, and intravascular. Generally, cutaneous metastases herald a poor prognosis. The average survival time of patients with skin metastases is a few months. In this article, we review the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of cutaneous metastases from internal malignancies, classify the most common cutaneous metastases, and identify studies that may assist in diagnosing the origin of a cutaneous metastasis.",valid

Recently, the least cost path (LCP) calculation coupled with population genetic data and species distribution models has been applied to reveal the landscape connectivity. In this study, we utilized the categorical LCP method, combining species distribution of three periods (the last interglacial, the last glacial maximum, and the current period) and locality with shared chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear haplotypes, to identify the possible dispersal routes of T. dumosa in the late Quaternary. Then, both a coalescent estimate of migration rates among regional groups and establishment of genetic divergence pattern were conducted. After those analyses, we found that the species generally migrated along the southern slope of Himalaya across time periods and genomic makers, and higher degree of dispersal was in the present and mtDNA haplotype. Furthermore, the direction of range shifts and strong level of gene flow also imply the existence of Himalayan dispersal path, and low area of genetic divergence pattern suggests that there are not any obvious barriers against the dispersal pathway. Above all, we inferred that a dispersal route along the Himalaya Mountains could exist, which is an important supplement for the evolutionary history of T. dumosa. Finally, we believed that this integrative genetic and geospatial method would bring new implications for the evolutionary process and conservation priority of species in the Tibetan Plateau.",valid

The aim of the work is to research a parenchymal involvement, through a close examination of our outpatient's record; compared with data from the literature on renal ptosis and with the results of a national questionnaire to specialists. The literature reports a largest incidence in females; in our cases, instead, the incidence is nearly the same. The 2nd degree ptosis is the most frequent, but, in females, bilateral ptosis is prevalent (77%). We agree with the literature about urinary symptoms; actually, the most of the patients shows urinary colics or lumbar pain. We also noticed UTI (62%), urinary lithiasis (26%) and pyelocalyceal ectasia (46%). A lot of patients suffer from microscopic hematuria (77%) and, in 12%, gross haematuria was noticed. Hypertension affects about an half of the patients (46%) and the proteinuria too (42%). Echography highlights a reduced cortex (12%), cysts (14%) and other changes (8%). GFR is decreased in 30% of cases, in different degree. The patients show different changes, according to their age. The results of the national questionnaire are also reported. In conclusion, considering the remarkable incidence and anatomical and functional changes, it is suggested to consider renal ptosis as a cause of chronic renal damage, also because it is included among the causes of obstructive nephropathy, which according to some researchers, can cause severe glomerular and tubular-interstitial changes, triggered off by a short urinary stasis and evident in the contralateral kidney too.",valid

We first performed a quantitative, immunocytochemical study on the levels of CaM-Kinase II alpha expression in the frontal, parietal and occipital cortical areas of control adult rats. We found that the levels of expression of CaM-Kinase II alpha were larger in the frontal and parietal areas than in the occipital areas. In addition, all layer V neurons identified as projecting to the spinal cord were CaM-Kinase II alpha immunopositive. We then grafted embryonic day (E) 12 or 14 cells from the presumptive frontal or occipital cortex of donor fetuses into the frontal or occipital cortex of newborn hosts. Cortical cells grafted at E12 differentiate neurons with molecular (CaM-Kinase II alpha) and connectivity (spinal cord projection) phenotypes appropriate to the cortical area where they complete their development whereas cells taken at E14 differentiate neurons with molecular and connectivity phenotypes appropriate to their cortical locus of origin. These findings suggest that E12 progenitors destined to generate layer V neurons are multipotent. The final phenotype of their progeny depends on regionalizing signals expressed in the environment. Later in corticogenesis, committed progenitors become unable to respond to regionalizing signals and generate neurons whose phenotype is appropriate to the initial cortical position of the precursor.",valid

26579583,"Comprehensive multiphase NMR is a novel NMR technique that permits all components (solutions, gels, and solids) to be studied in unaltered natural samples. In this study a wide range of CMP-NMR interaction and editing-based experiments are combined to follow contaminants (pentafluorophenol (PFP) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)) from the solution state (after a spill) through the gel-state and finally into the true solid-state (sequestered) in an intact water-swollen soil. Kinetics experiments monitoring each phase illustrate PFOA rapidly transfers from solution to the solid phase while for PFP the process is slower with longer residence times in the solution and gel phase. Interaction-based experiments reveal that PFOA enters the soil via its hydrophobic tails and selectively binds to soil microbial protein. PFP sorption shows less specificity exhibiting interactions with a range of gel and solid soil components with a preference toward aromatics (mainly lignin). The results indicate that in addition to more traditional measurements such as Koc, other factors including the influence of the contaminant on the soil-water interface, specific biological interactions, soil composition (content of lignin, protein, etc.) and physical accessibility/swellability of soil organic components will likely be central to better explaining and predicting the true behavior of contaminants in soil.",valid
9506849,"Glycosaminoglycans regulate angiogenesis by affecting the availability of different growth factors for the endothelial cell (EC). However, little is known about the molecular and functional consequences resulting from direct interaction of these polyelectrolytes with the EC. Here we show that heparin markedly inhibited serum-stimulated DNA synthesis and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) mRNA expression in human endothelial cells (HEC). About 50% of the serum effect on DNA synthesis and ODC gene expression was prevented by the selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine or by PKC down-regulation. Heparin was ineffective in counteracting that part of the effect of serum that was resistant to PKC inhibition or down-regulation. In serum-free cultured HEC, heparin completely abolished the increase in DNA synthesis and ODC mRNA expression elicited by a number of PKC activators. Cell exposure to difluoromethylornithine, an irreversible inhibitor of ODC enzyme, dramatically antagonised both serum- and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated DNA synthesis. These results suggest that inhibition of PKC-mediated ODC gene expression by glycosaminoglycans may represent an important mechanism in the regulation of HEC proliferation.",valid

Methylcellulose medium was used in the colony-forming experiment which was also in four groups as previously. The number of cells and colony-forming units in each well for the four groups was evaluated at different time points (day 1, 3, 7) with fluorescence microscopy counting method. Division of single cell was observed to be amplified in all of these groups from day 3. And meanwhile, after 1-week culture, the survival rates for the treated groups were all higher than the control group (Jagged-1 group > BMP-4 group > Shh group > control), while the cell number in each well was also highest in the Jagged-1 group (Jagged-1 group > BMP-4 group > control). The number of wells with a cell number of zero was significantly fewer in all treated groups (especially the Jagged-1 group) than in the control group; meanwhile, the number of wells with a cell number higher than 17 was evidently higher in all the treated groups (especially the BMP-4 group) more than controls.

In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, 466 patients with B-NHL who completed an R-CHOP regimen within a 7-year period and who planned to undergo at least three cycles of this regimen were analyzed. The following FN-related factors were assessed: fever, infection, disease state, neutrophil count, and prophylactic interventions such as use of antibiotics and/or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). We simulated the FN incidence and 95% confidence interval (CI) of patients without prophylaxis with G-CSF (cycle 1) using bootstrap sampling. The incidence of FN was 9.1% (42 of 462) in cycle 1 and 12.3% (57 of 462 patients) throughout all cycles, with 73.7% (42/57) developing FN during cycle 1. Risk factors for FN among patients with B-NHL treated with R-CHOP were albumin <35 g/L (p = 0.0047), relative dose intensity <85% (p = 0.0007), and lack of prophylaxis with G-CSF (p = 0.0006) in cycle 1.

To be useful as a general tool that cuts through the complex fabric of cognition, we need at least two-bladed scissors that combine both computational and psychological constraints to characterize human behavior. To temper its sometimes expansive claims, it is time to show what a Bayesian model cannot explain.

Here, we report that ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (Usp14, a deubiquitinating enzyme) is closely associated with HIE progression by its negative regulation in neuronal mitophagy in mouse. The expression of Usp14 is elevated in both an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) mouse neuronal cell line culture model in vitro and a HIE mouse model in vivo. Mechanistically, OGD treatment activates Hippo signaling that enhances Yap1 phosphorylation levels at Ser-127 but inhibits Yap1 protein level, which potentiates Usp14 transcription and leads to the downregulated ubiquitination at Lys-63 of Beclin-1, a key molecule in autophagy, resulting in the suppressed neuronal mitophagy, subsequent failure in the clearance of damaged neurons, and finally possible dysregulation in brain functions. Thus, our results provide with Usp14 as a novel target and treatment strategy for intervention of HIE, which may help diagnose and treat HIE in clinic.",valid

23569286,"This paper introduces a Theme Issue presenting the latest developments in research on the interplay between flexibility and constraint in social behaviour, using comparative datasets, long-term field studies and experimental data from both field and laboratory studies of mammals. We first explain our focus on mammals and outline the main components of their social systems, focusing on variation within- and among-species in numerous aspects of social organization, mating system and social structure. We then review the current state of primarily ultimate explanations of this diversity in social behaviour. We approach the question of how and why the balance between behavioural flexibility and continuity is achieved by discussing the genetic, developmental, ecological and social constraints on hypothetically unlimited behavioural flexibility. We introduce the other contributions to this Theme Issue against this background and conclude that constraints are often crucial to the evolution and expression of behavioural flexibility. In exploring these issues, the enduring relevance of Tinbergen's seminal paper 'On aims and methods in ethology', with its advocacy of an integrative, four-pronged approach to studying behaviour becomes apparent: an exceptionally fitting tribute on the 50th anniversary of its publication.",valid

In this study, we aimed to further characterize functional decrements in a spectrum of RA-associated ILD. All subjects were enrolled in the Brigham and Women's Hospital Rheumatoid Arthritis Sequential Study (BRASS). The presence of interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) on clinically indicated chest CT scans was determined using a previously validated sequential reading method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the association between degree of ILAs and physiologic, functional, and demographic variables of interest. Of 1,145 BRASS subjects, 91 subjects (8%) were included in this study. Twelve had radiologically severe ILAs, 34 had ILAs, and 38 had no ILAs on CT scan. Subjects with radiologically severe ILAs were older (P = .0037), had increased respiratory symptoms (cough, P = .027; dyspnea, P = .010), and more severe RA disease (rheumatoid factor, P = .018; total swollen joints, P = .046) compared with subjects with no ILAs. Participants also had a trend toward having an increased smoking history (P = .16) and having lower FVC % predicted (77% vs 94%, P = .097) and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide % predicted (52% vs 77%, P = .068). Similar but attenuated increases in respiratory symptoms, functional decrements, and RA disease severity were observed in subjects with ILAs compared with those with no ILAs. We have shown that patients with RA have varying degrees of ILAs that are associated with a spectrum of functional and physiologic decrements. Our findings suggest that improved risk stratification and detection of ILAs will provide a therapeutic window that could improve RA-ILD outcomes.",valid

Plasma concentrations of 25-OHD3 (13 pmol/ml) and 25, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (0.9 pmol/ml) were 18 and 125% greater than controls, respectively, whereas the corresponding level for 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (0.3 pmol/ml) was only 30% of control. Plasma disappearance of 25-HOD3 was fitted using a two-compartment model in which the metabolite extrapolated half-life was nearly twice as large for strontium rachitic chicks (71 compared to 41 h). Intestinal sequestration of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was assumed to be irreversible and was fitted by a single exponential term in which metabolite uptake rate and tissue concentration in strontium rickets was suppressed to 20 and 10% of control, respectively. In contrast, uptake of 25-OHD3 by the intestine was observed to occur by a reversible process in which metabolite concentration was 45% greater in the strontium rachitic compared to control group.

In mice, P53 deletion in all cells leads predominantly to the development of T-cell lymphomas, followed by B-cell lymphomas, sarcomas and teratomas. In order to dissect the role of P53 in the hematopoietic system, we generated and analyzed two different mouse models deficient for P53. A pan-hematopoietic P53 deletion mouse was created using Vav1-Cre based deletion; and a B-cell-specific deletion mouse was created using a CD19-Cre based deletion. The Vav1-P53CKO mice predominantly developed T-cell malignancies in younger mice, and myeloid malignancies in older mice. In T-cell malignancies, there was accelerated thymic cell maturation with overexpression of Notch1 and its downstream effectors. CD19-P53CKO mice developed marginal zone expansion in the spleen, followed by marginal zone lymphoma, some of which progressed to diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Interestingly, marginal zone and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas had a unique gene expression signature characterized by activation of the PI3K pathway, compared with wild type marginal zone or follicular cells of the spleen. This study demonstrates lineage specific P53 deletion leading to distinct phenotypes secondary to unique gene expression programs set in motion.",valid

PMS defines a constellation of symptoms confined to the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle interfering with individual function but clears after menstruation in the follicular phase. Though there is no consensus yet on its etiopathogenesis, the various models, inconsistent as they are, can initiate or sustain hypertension. The two patients presented had been frustrated by the attitude of their attending physicians who branded them neurotics and the fact that various drug combinations would not control their blood pressure. The classical recurring nature of their symptoms in relation to the menstrual cycle led to the suspicion of and treatment of PMS. With this, it became easy to control their erstwhile ""refractory"" hypertension. It is, therefore, recommended that history of PMS be sought and attended to, when premenopausal women without evidence of secondary hypertension have high blood pressures that proove difficult to control.",valid

Improving the efficiency of spermatogenesis in xenografted testicular tissue will aid in the application of using this approach. The present study was conducted to evaluate age-related differences in the establishment of spermatogenesis in grafted testicular tissue from bulls between 2 and 16 wk of life. Testicular tissue was ectopically xenografted under the skin on the backs of castrated nude mice and subsequently evaluated for growth, testosterone production, and establishment of spermatogenesis 24 wk after grafting. The greatest weight increases occurred in donor tissue from calves of the ages 2, 4, and 8 wk compared with the ages of 12 and 16 wk. Recipient mouse serum testosterone concentration was at normal physiological levels 24 wk after grafting and no significant differences were detected between recipients grafted with testicular tissue from bull calves of different ages. The development of germ cells to elongated spermatids were observed in seminiferous tubules of grafts from donor calves of the ages 4, 8, 12, and 16 wk but not observed in grafts from 2-wk donors, which contained round spermatids as the most advanced germ cell stage. Grafts from 8-wk donors contained a significantly higher (10-fold) average percentage of seminiferous tubules with elongated spermatids than all other donor ages.

The fundamental principles of DIAAD rely on the induction of high zone tolerance to the ""wild type"" (normal) antigen. followed by immunization with the modified (diseased) antigen. Because chronic myelogenic leukemia (CML) cells are derived from a lineage closely related to MM, we immunized mice by contrasting a pool of MM cells with CML cells. Monoclonal antibody VAC69 reacted exclusively with MM cells, identifying a membrane molecule composed of a single-chain glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 78-120 kd. This antigen exhibited narrow tissue specificity and was not found on human cancers such as prostate, breast, or cervical carcinoma; leukemia; or lymphoma, nor was it seen on normal human peripheral lymphocytes or on Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell lines. By immunohistochemistry, mAb VAC69 showed no binding to antigens expressed on normal human ovary, breast, prostate, lung or colon tissue, nor did it bind to human breast or prostate cancer. Conversely, mAb VAC69 bound strongly to human MM, although showing only slight binding to histiocytes or inflamed cells in human lymph nodes and human tumors of the colon, lung, and ovary. Monoclonal antibody VAC69 also triggered cancer-specific cytotoxicity in vitro (in the presence of complement) as well as in vivo using a sever combined immunodeficiency model transplanted with human MM. Further studies showed the ability of mAb VAC69 to be specifically internalized by human MM cells, indicating its potential use for therapeutic intervention in MM by delivering drugs into cancer cells.",valid

Additionally, we assessed the effect of a 0.12% chlorhexidine (CHX) and saline solution in S. mutans biofilms. The biofilms were grown in discs of composite resin for 48h and exposed to B. dracunculifolia, CHX or saline solution for 5min. The viability of the biofilms was determined by counting the colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) in agar, which was statistically significant (P<0.05). The MIC of the B. dracunculifolia EO to planktonic growth of S. mutans was 6%. In biofilms of S. mutans clinical isolates, B. dracunculifolia EO (6%) and CHX resulted in reductions of 53.3-91.1% and 79.1-96.6%, respectively. For the biofilm formed by the S. mutans reference strain, the reductions achieved with B. dracunculifolia EO and CHX were, respectively, 39.3% and 88.1%.

9549516,"A previously unrecognized neuropathy was identified in Bulgarian gypsies, and was designated hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Lom (HMSNL) after the town where the initial cases were found. It was subsequently identified in other gypsy communities. The disorder, which is of autosomal recessive inheritance, was mapped to chromosome 8q24. It begins consistently in the first decade of life with gait disorder followed by upper limb weakness in the second decade and, in most subjects, by deafness which is most often first noticed in the third decade. Sensory loss affecting all modalities is present, both this and the motor involvement predominating distally in the limbs. Skeletal deformity, particularly foot deformity, is frequent. Severely reduced motor nerve conduction velocity indicates a demyelinating basis, which was confirmed by nerve biopsy. The three younger patients biopsied showed a hypertrophic 'onion bulb' neuropathy. The hypertrophic changes were not evident in the oldest individual biopsied and it is likely that they had regressed secondarily to axon loss. In the eight cases in which brainstem auditory evoked potentials could be recorded, the results suggested demyelination in the eighth cranial nerve and also abnormal conduction in the central auditory pathways in the brainstem. As no myelin genes are known to be located at chromosome 8q24, the disorder may involve a gene for a novel myelin protein or be due to an abnormality of axon-Schwann cell signalling.",valid

A61603 was the most potent alpha-1-agonist in activating ERK in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. A61603 activated ERK in adult mouse ventricular myocytes and protected the cells from death caused by the anthracycline doxorubicin. A low dose of A61603 (10 ng/kg/d) activated ERK in the mouse heart in vivo, but did not change blood pressure. In male mice, concurrent subcutaneous A61603 infusion at 10 ng/kg/d for 7 days after a single intraperitoneal dose of doxorubicin (25 mg/kg) increased survival, improved cardiac function, heart rate, and cardiac output by echocardiography, and reduced cardiac cell necrosis and apoptosis and myocardial fibrosis. All protective effects were lost in alpha-1A-knockout mice. In female mice, doxorubicin at doses higher than in males (35-40 mg/kg) caused less cardiac toxicity than in males. We conclude that the alpha-1A-selective agonist A61603, via the alpha-1A adrenergic receptor, prevents doxorubicin cardiomyopathy in male mice, supporting the theory that alpha-1A adrenergic receptor agonists have potential as novel heart failure therapies.",valid

29053434,"Glutaraldehyde (GLA) has been used to crosslink bioprosthetic heart valve (BHVs) tissues to enhance their stability, besides ensuring a satisfactory degree of immunological tolerance. Unfortunately, GLA fixation does not guarantee a complete tissue biocompatibility of BHVs in currently used devices. The interaction between preformed human anti-alpha-Gal antibody and alpha-Gal antigens promotes the calcification of GLA-treated alpha-Gal-positive tissue. Recently, an alarming correlation between the presence of the alpha-Gal epitope and a premature BHVs degeneracy was reported. This article presents the results of a novel treatment called FACTA, for the inactivation of the alpha-Gal epitopes in porcine aortic valve tissue and commercial BHVs. Evaluation of the alpha-Gal epitope inactivation was performed through a patented ELISA test, confirmed by western blot, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemical analyses. Investigations were also conducted to assess the in vitro propensity to trigger thrombosis, calcification, and worsening of FACTA-treated tissue. To explain the mechanism of action through which the FACTA treatment acts, a specific experimental model, based on the mass spectroscopy approach, was performed. The study confirms that GLA is able to ensure the inactivation of approximately half alpha-Gal epitopes originally present in both porcine aortic valve tissue and marketed BHVs. By subjecting tissues to the FACTA procedure, it was possible to obtain an alpha-Gal inactivation degree of about 95% alongside to a reduced propensity from 72.6% to 85.4% to the in vitro calcification for porcine aortic valve tissue and 80.5% for commercial treated BHVs. FACTA was effective in decreasing oxidative tissue damage and protecting collagen from degradation. Finally, FACTA could further mitigate or even abrogate the need for early anticoagulation therapies after BHV implantation. A novel treatment, called FACTA, is effective to produce biological tissues that are less susceptible to enzymatic and oxidative stress and structural degradation, calcification, and thrombus formation. FACTA-treated tissues display a clear improvement of their biocompatibility that is characterized by an almost complete inactivation of the alpha-Gal epitope. FACTA prevents the xenogeneic tissue antigens from reacting with the host immune system, ensuring an effective shield effect that makes the tissue surface less reactive and more biocompatible.",valid

In neuroscience applications, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been used to improve electronic device performance by exploiting their physical properties. Besides, when manufactured to interface neuronal networks formation in vitro, CNT carpets have shown their unique ability to potentiate synaptic networks formation and function. Due to the low optical transparency of CNTs films, further developments of these materials in neural prosthesis fabrication or in implementing interfacing devices to be paired with in vivo imaging or in vitro optogenetic approaches are currently limited.

Intracellular antigen localisation studies were performed on (fractionated) neutrophils using antigen-specific antibodies. In contrast to vasculitis associated ANCA, ulcerative colitis p-ANCA are mainly of IgG1 and IgG3 subclass and lack IgG4. Ulcerative colitis p-ANCA are myeloid specific.

22906180,"Four of the five species of Telopea (Proteaceae) are distributed in a latitudinal replacement pattern on the south-eastern Australian mainland. In similar circumstances, a simple allopatric speciation model that identifies the origins of genetic isolation within temporal geographic separation is considered as the default model. However, secondary contact between differentiated lineages can result in similar distributional patterns to those arising from a process of parapatric speciation (where gene flow between lineages remains uninterrupted during differentiation). Our aim was to use the characteristic distributional patterns in Telopea to test whether it reflected the evolutionary models of allopatric or parapatric speciation. Using a combination of genetic evidence and environmental niche modelling, we focused on three main questions: do currently described geographic borders coincide with genetic and environmental boundaries; are there hybrid zones in areas of secondary contact between closely related species; did species distributions contract during the last glacial maximum resulting in distributional gaps even where overlap and hybridisation currently occur? Total genomic DNA was extracted from 619 individuals sampled from 36 populations representing the four species. Seven nuclear microsatellites (nSSR) and six chloroplast microsatellites (cpSSR) were amplified across all populations. Genetic structure and the signature of admixture in overlap zones was described using the Bayesian clustering methods implemented in STUCTURE and NewHybrids respectively. Relationships between chlorotypes were reconstructed as a median-joining network. Environmental niche models were produced for all species using environmental parameters from both the present day and the last glacial maximum (LGM).The nSSR loci amplified a total of 154 alleles, while data for the cpSSR loci produced a network of six chlorotypes. STRUCTURE revealed an optimum number of five clusters corresponding to the four recognised species with the additional division of T. speciosissima into populations north and south of the Shoalhaven River valley. Unexpectedly, the northern disjunct population of T. oreades grouped with T. mongaensis and was identified as a hybrid swarm by the Bayesian assignment test implemented in NewHybrids. Present day and LGM environmental niche models differed dramatically, suggesting that distributions of all species had repeatedly expanded and contracted in response to Pleistocene climatic oscillations and confirming strongly marked historical distributional gaps among taxes. Genetic structure and bio-climatic modeling results are more consistent with a history of allopatric speciation followed by repeated episodes of secondary contact and localised hybridisation, rather than with parapatric speciation. This study on Telopea shows that the evidence for temporal exclusion of gene flow can be found even outside obvious geographical contexts, and that it is possible to make significant progress towards excluding parapatric speciation as a contributing evolutionary process.",valid
3707149,"THP-adriamycin (THP) is a new derivative of adriamycin (ADM) which is reported to have a lower cardiotoxicity than ADM. In this report, the effects of THP on cell growth, cell cycle traverse and colony-forming ability of RPMI-8402 cells were investigated in comparison with ADM. The growth-inhibitory effect of THP was equal or superior to that of ADM in this system. Analysis of the DNA histogram obtained by flow cytometry showed that THP exerted its growth-inhibitory effect by blocking cells at the G2 phase. At higher concentrations, THP inhibited the traverse of cells through the S phase and further through the whole cell cycle completely. These effects were quite similar to those of ADM, which suggested a similar mechanism of action for the two drugs from the aspect of the cell cycle. A follow-up study of cells accumulated at the G2 phase and a study on colony-forming ability revealed that the G2 phase accumulation was an irreversible and fatal effect of THP, so that G2-phase accumulation could be considered as a cytocidal effect of THP, indicating the clinical usefulness of this system for evaluation of the drug effect.

In this study, Vpx/Vpr proteins from diverse primate lentiviral lineages were experimentally and phylogenetically analyzed to obtain the general expression picture in cells. While both the level and PPM-dependency of Vpx/Vpr expression in transfected cells varied among viral strains, each viral group, based on Vpx/Vpr amino acid sequences, was found to exhibit a characteristic expression profile. Moreover, phylogenetic tree analyses on Gag and Vpx/Vpr proteins gave essentially the same results. Taken together, our study described here suggests that each primate lentiviral lineage may have developed a unique expression pattern of Vpx/Vpr proteins for adaptation to its hostile cellular and species environments in the process of viral evolution.",valid
2509123,"Treatment of malignant tumors with interferon (IFN) is in some patients accompanied by serious neurological side effects. The present study assessed neurophysiological changes in spontaneous EEG activity, visual-evoked cortical potentials (VEPs), and brainstem auditory-evoked potentials (BAEPs) during IFN-gamma or IFN-alpha therapy in 9 patients. In addition, blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature were monitored. In all sessions under IFN, the latency of the P100 component of the VEP was shortened as compared to baseline conditions. IFN also reduced latencies of BAEP components, and diminished amplitudes of the spontaneous EEG activity within the alpha and beta frequency band. These latter effects were somewhat less consistent than those on VEPs. The major neurophysiological changes appeared to be similar for IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha. The results are in accord with an excitatory effect of IFN on central nervous activity. The magnitude of changes excludes a neurotoxicity of IFN-gamma or IFN-alpha at the doses used in this study.",valid

A retrospective review of patients with hemothoraces on CAT was performed. Extrapolating previously described methods of pleural fluid measurement, hemothoraces were quantified using the fluid stripe in the dependent pleural ""gutter."" Data included patient age, injury severity, and intervention (thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy). Seventy-eight patients with 99 occult hemothoraces met the criteria for study inclusion: 52 hemothoraces qualified as ""minimal"" and 47 as ""moderate/large."" Eight patients (15%) in the minimal group and 31 patients (66%) in the moderate/large group underwent intervention (P < .001). There was no difference in patient age, injury severity, ventilator requirement, or presence of pulmonary contusion. CAT in stable blunt-trauma patients can predict which patients with occult hemothorax are likely to undergo intervention. Patients with hemothorax > or = 1.5 cm on CAT were 4 times more likely to undergo drainage intervention compared with those having hemothorax < 1.5 cm.",valid

16934627,"The purpose of this study was to determine if electronic apex locators (EAL) or electric pulp testers (EPT) interfere with the function of implanted cardiac pacemakers (ICP) or cardioverter/defibrillators (ICD). Twenty-seven patients with ICPs or ICDs had continuous electrocardiogram monitoring and device interrogation to detect interferences during the use of two types of EALs and one EPT. No interferences were detected by any ICP or ICD. In six patients, with intermittent pacing, a significant increase in pacing was observed during EAL/EPT stimulation (p < 0.05). Examination of RR intervals (a measure of intrinsic heart rate) demonstrated significantly longer RR intervals (slower intrinsic heart rate) during EAL/EPT stimulation (p < 0.05). Evaluation of the electrocardiograms for each patient failed to show any abnormalities in pacing during testing. These findings led us to conclude that the increased pacing frequency observed was related to a slower intrinsic heart rate and not electrical interference with the cardiac devices. In conclusion, the two EALs and one EPT used in this study did not interfere with the functioning of any of the cardiac devices tested.",valid

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of a transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) polymorphism (-509C>T) with ACS in a Chinese Han population. The TGF-β1 polymorphism was evaluated in 336 patients with ACS and 396 healthy control subjects by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The genotype distributions of the control and ACS groups were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (X(2) = 3.54 and X(2) = 1.72, respectively, P > 0.05). The frequencies of the CC, CT, and TT genotypes were 22.61, 53.57, and 20.83% in the ACS group, respectively, whereas they were 8.33, 48.74, and 42.17% in controls. There were significant differences between controls and ACS patients in the frequencies of the CC genotype and the C allele. These results suggest that the promoter polymorphism (-509C>T) in TGF-β1 is associated with ACS in this population. The CC genotype and the C allele of TGF-β1 might be a specific risk factor of ACS in the Chinese Han population in Xinjiang.",valid
8817245,"To analyze the relative contribution of endocrine and physical factors to bone mineral density (BMD) in late menopause, we studied biochemical markers of bone turnover as well as sex and calciotropic hormones in 53 women (mean age 61 +/- 5.3 years), 5 to 23 years after natural menopause. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine and proximal femur by dual energy radiography. Stepwise regression analysis showed that age and PTH levels were the two major factors that significantly accounted for spinal BMD, with a final r2 = 0.27. Plasma androstenedione was the only other variable that contributed, albeit not significantly, to spine BMD increasing the r2 by 2%. Conversely, body mass was the main contributor to femoral BMD at all sites. While serum calcium and urinary hydroxyproline were significant determinants of neck BMD, urinary hydroxyproline and age provided significant source of variation for trochanteric BMD, and circulating FSH for BMD in the Ward's area. The final models gave r2 values of 0.35, 0.31, and 0.23, for neck, trochanter and Ward's areas, respectively. Thus, determinants of bone density differentially affect the vertebral and proximal femoral sites. While increasing age and PTH, probably reflecting a subclinical vitamin D deficiency, explain a decreased vertebral bone density, body mass appears to affect mostly the proximal femur. Circulating androgens play a secondary role. A persistently increased bone turnover state is conducive to lower bone density in late postmenopausal women.",valid

However, the industry suffers heavy economic losses each year due to disease outbreaks caused by pathogenic bacteria. In the present study, after Vibrio alginolyticus infection, DNA damage in the hemocytes of the shrimp markedly increased, and autophagy and apoptosis increased significantly. Subsequently, hemocytes were sampled from the control and infected shrimp and sequenced for mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) 24 h after V. alginolyticus infection to better understand the response mechanism to bacterial infection in P. vannamei. We identified 1,874 and 263 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMs) respectively, and predicted that 997 DEGs were targeted by DEMs. These DEGs were involved in the regulation of multiple signalling pathways, such as Toll and IMD signalling, TGF-beta signalling, MAPK signalling, and cell apoptosis, during Vibrio alginolyticus infection of the shrimp.

38562295,"We propose a novel approach for the reconstruction of functional networks representing brain dynamics based on the idea that the coparticipation of two brain regions in a common cognitive task should result in a drop in their identifiability, or in the uniqueness of their dynamics. This identifiability is estimated through the score obtained by deep learning models in supervised classification tasks and therefore requires no a priori assumptions about the nature of such coparticipation. The method is tested on EEG recordings obtained from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients, and matched healthy volunteers, for eyes-open and eyes-closed resting-state conditions, and the resulting functional networks are analysed through standard topological metrics. Both groups of patients are characterised by a reduction in the identifiability of the corresponding EEG signals, and by differences in the patterns that support such identifiability. Resulting functional networks are similar, but not identical to those reconstructed by using a correlation metric. Differences between control subjects and patients can be observed in network metrics like the clustering coefficient and the assortativity in different frequency bands. Differences are also observed between eyes open and closed conditions, especially for Parkinson's disease patients.",valid
12544379,"Clozapine (CLZ) dose-related adverse effects may be more common in children than adults, perhaps reflecting developmental pharmacokinetic (PK) differences. However, no pediatric CLZ PK data are available. Accordingly, we studied CLZ and its metabolites, norclozapine (NOR), and clozapine-N-oxide (NOX) in six youth, ages 9-16 years, with childhood onset schizophrenia (COS). At the time of the PK study, mean CLZ dose was 200 mg (3.4 mg/kg). Serum was collected during week 6 on CLZ before and 0.5-8 h after a morning dose. Serum concentrations were assayed by liquid chromatography/UV-detection. Mean concentration, area-under-the-curve (AUC), and clearance were calculated. CLZ clearance averaged 1.7 L/kg-h. NOR concentrations (410) exceeded CLZ (289) and NOX (63 ng/ml) and AUC(0-8h) of NOR (3,356) > CLZ (2,359) > NOX (559 ng/ml-h) [53, 38, and 9% of total analytes, respectively]. In adults, NOR serum concentrations on average are 10-25% < CLZ, differing significantly from our sample. Dose normalized concentrations of CLZ (mg/kg-d) did not vary with age and were similar to reported adult values. Clinical improvement seen in 5/6 patients correlated with serum CLZ concentrations. In addition, clinical response and total number of side effects correlated with NOR concentrations. NOR (a neuropharmacologically active metabolite) and free CLZ may contribute to the effectiveness and adverse effects in youth.",valid
26940700,"Disruption of sleep/wake cycles is common in patients with schizophrenia and correlates with cognitive and affective abnormalities. Mice deficient in stable tubule only polypeptide (STOP) show cognitive, behavioral, and neurobiological deficits that resemble those seen in patients with schizophrenia, but little is known about their sleep phenotype. We characterized baseline sleep/wake patterns and recovery sleep following sleep deprivation in STOP null mice. Polysomnography was conducted in adult male STOP null and wild-type (WT) mice under a 12:12 hours light:dark cycle before, during, and after 6 hours of sleep deprivation during the light phase. At baseline, STOP null mice spent more time awake and less time in non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) over a 24-hour period, with more frequent transitions between wake and NREMS, compared to WT mice, especially during the dark phase. The distributions of wake, NREMS and REMS across the light and the dark phases differed by genotype, and so did features of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Following sleep deprivation, both genotypes showed homeostatic increases in sleep duration, with no significant genotype differences in the initial compensatory increase in sleep intensity (EEG delta power). These results indicate that STOP null mice sleep less overall, and their sleep and wake periods are more fragmented than those of WT mice. These features in STOP null mice are consistent with the sleep patterns observed in patients with schizophrenia.",valid

38179126,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic degenerative joint disease. Due to the limited understanding of its complex pathological mechanism, there is currently no effective treatment that can alleviate or even reverse cartilage damage associated with OA. With improvement in public databases, researchers have successfully identified the key factors involved in the occurrence and development of OA through bioinformatics analysis. The aim of this study was to screen for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the normal and OA cartilage through bioinformatics, and validate the function of the TGF-β1/Smad2/3 pathway-related neuron regeneration related protein (NREP) in the articular cartilage. The DEGs between the cartilage tissues of OA patients and healthy controls were screened by bioinformatics, and functionally annotated by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. The expression levels of the DEG in human and murine OA cartilage was verified by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). RT-qPCR, Western-blotting, Cell Counting Kit-8(CCK8) and EdU assays were used to evaluate the effects of knocking down NREP in normal chondrocytes, and the molecular mechanisms were investigated by RT-qPCR, Western blotting and IHC. In this study, we identified NREP as a DEG in OA through bioinformatics analysis, and found that NREP was downregulated in the damaged articular cartilage of OA patients and mouse model with surgically-induced OA. In addition, knockdown of NREP in normal chondrocytes reduced their proliferative capacity, which is the pathological basis of OA. At the molecular level, knock-down of NREP inactivated the TGF-β1/Smad2/3 pathway, resulting in the downregulation of the anabolic markers Col2a1 and Sox9, and an increase in the expression of the catabolic markers MMP3 and MMP13. NREP plays a key role in the progression of OA by regulating the TGF-β1/Smad2/3 pathway in chondrocytes, and warrants further study as a potential therapeutic target.",valid

MATERIAL AND METHODS An AR model was produced in BALB/c mice, and the viral encoding interleukin (IL)-9 silencing sequence was used to reduce IL-9 expression. The experiment was divided into a control group, an AR group, an IL-9 shRNA+AR group, and a vector+AR group. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to detect pathological changes. The cytokine expression was detected by ELISA method. Cellular typing was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS Cells in the control group were regularly arranged, with clear layers and no congestion, edema, or necrosis observable. By contrast, in the AR model group and the vector treatment group, nasal mucosa showed clear hyperemia and edema in upper tissues and infiltration of inflammatory cells, which were ameliorated by IL-9 silencing. Compared with the control group, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was significantly down-regulated, while IL-4, IL-17, and IL-9 were significantly elevated in the AR model group. TH1 cells in nasal mucosa, lymph, nasal lavage, spleen, and peripheral blood were significantly reduced, while TH2, TH9, TH17, and Treg cells were significantly elevated in the AR group compared with the control group. Importantly, all these changes in AR model were ameliorated by IL-9 silencing. CONCLUSIONS AR is related to the changes of cytokines in TH1, TH2, TH9, TH17, and Treg, which are improved by IL-9 silencing. Activation of TH9 cells is involved in the pathogenesis of AR.",valid

Few studies have evaluated these important psychiatric conditions that may lead to adverse outcomes in young adults. We aimed to determine the prevalence of PSD and anxiety as well as to identify their predictors in a population of young Filipino adults (18-49 years old). We performed a cross-sectional epidemiologic study in the largest tertiary hospital in the Philippines. The study involved the administration of a structured survey tool and review of medical records. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score - Pilipino version (HADS-P) was used to screen for anxiety and depression. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine significant socio-economic and clinical risk factors of PSD and anxiety. 114 young adult stroke patients were included. The prevalence of depression was 20.2% while that of anxiety was 34.2%. Significant predictors of PSD were the presence of anxiety (OR 1.84; CI 1.05-3.22), lower mRS scores (mRS 3-5 OR 5.52; 95% CI 1.09-8.03) and diabetes (OR 2.09; 95% CI 1.67-6.26). Meanwhile, significant predictors of poststroke anxiety included depression (OR 7.5; 95% CI 5.02-21.94) and dependency (Barthel Index scores 95-100; OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.89-0.99).

21478059,"We demonstrate use of restricted access media with reversed phase functionality (RAM-RP) for analysis of low molecular weight proteins and peptides in mouse serum (75 μl) using a custom designed modular automated processing system (MAPS). RAM-RP fractionation with simultaneous removal of high molecular weight and high abundance proteins is integrated with a follow-on buffer exchange module (BE) to ensure compatibility with subsequent processing steps (trypsin digestion and intact peptide separation prior to mass spectrometric analysis). The high sample capacity afforded by chromatographic methods generates enough sample to achieve comprehensive serum peptidome identification (357 proteins) through tandem mass spectrometric analysis of both intact and digested peptides. Sample losses during transfer between modules are minimized through precise fluidic control; no clogging occurred over several months of serum processing in our low back pressure system. Computer controlled operation of both modules and thorough optimization yield excellent run-to-run reproducibility and protein/peptide overlap in analytical repeats. The robustness of our results demonstrate that the RAM-RP-BE workflow executed on our MAPS platform shows tremendous potential for high throughput peptidome processing, particularly with regard to direct analysis of small-volume serum samples.",valid

An experimental study was carried out during 56 days, in patients assigned to 4 groups: control, control+LC, fructose and fructose+LC. Patients in the fructose group received treatment during 56 days, and those in the LC groups were treated during the last 28 days. Fructose was given on demand and LC was administered orally at a dose of 500 g/kg/24 h. Lipid peroxidation (MDA), superoxide dismutase activity, free LC and mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial proteins were measured in liver tissue. Glycemia, insulin and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were measured in blood plasma. We measured insulin concentration and studied the histology of pancreatic tissue. LC treatment showed a decrease (p < 0.05) of MDA when compared to the control group (21.73 ± 5.36 nmol/g tissue vs. 64.46 ± 7.87 nmol/g tissue).

27004840,"Central brain network connections greatly contribute to overall network efficiency. Here we examined whether small vessel disease (SVD) related white matter alterations in central brain network connections have a greater impact on executive functioning than alterations in non-central brain network connections. Brain networks were reconstructed from diffusion-weighted MRI scans in 72 individuals (75 ± 8 years) with cognitive impairment and SVD on MRI. The centrality of white matter connections in the network was defined using graph theory. The association between the fractional anisotropy (FA) of central versus non-central connections, executive functioning, and markers of SVD was evaluated with linear regression and mediation analysis. Lower FA in central network connections was more strongly associated with impairment in executive functioning than FA in non-central network connections (r = 0.41 vs. r = 0.27; P < 0.05). Results were consistent across varying thresholds to define the central subnetwork (>50%-10% connections). Higher SVD burden was associated with lower FA in central as well as non-central network connections. However, only central network FA mediated the relationship between white matter hyperintensity volume and executive functioning [change in regression coefficient after mediation (95% CI): -0.15 (-0.35 to -0.02)]. The mediation effect was not observed for FA alterations in non-central network connections [-0.03 (-0.19 to 0.04)]. These findings suggest that the centrality of network connections, and thus their contribution to global network efficiency, appears to be relevant for understanding the relationship between SVD and cognitive impairment.

Two tumours with the highest biochemical assays showed positive staining for the enzyme, and 2 tumours with the lowest levels showed no appreciable staining. The highest level of enolase was present in a tumour which both clinically and histologically appeared to be benign, and the lowest level occurred in a mixed cell tumour which was large in size; the low level presumably related to its relatively fast rate of growth. Estimation of gamma enolase activity in ocular melanomas may provide an accurate quantitative method for assessing the malignant potential of these tumours.",valid
19125961,"Objectives To assess the prevalence, clinical and immunological characteristics, risk factors and survival of patients with AIDS-related cryptococcosis in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Methods All newly diagnosed cryptococcosis cases identified retrospectively from among a series of AIDS patients hospitalized consecutively at a single institution in Italy in 1985-1996 (pre-HAART period, n=165) and 1997-2006 (post-HAART period, n=40) were analysed comparatively. Results The prevalence of cryptococcosis decreased from 4.7% (165/3543) to 2.2% (40/1805) between the pre- and post-HAART periods (P=0.0001). There were no differences in the clinical features or immunological status of the patients between the two cohorts. The variables associated with the occurrence of cryptococcosis in the post-HAART era were older age (P<0.001), no previous diagnosis of HIV infection (P<0.001) and infection in homosexual males (P=0.004). During the post-HAART period, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome associated with cryptococcosis was observed in five patients (19.3%) a median of 15 weeks after the start of HAART. Thirty-day survival (P=0.045) and overall survival (P=0.0001) were significantly better among patients diagnosed with cryptococcosis in the post-HAART compared to those diagnosed in the pre-HAART era. Conclusions The AIDS-associated cryptococcosis observed in Western countries in the HAART era has similar clinical and immunological characteristics to that observed in the pre-HAART era, but a significantly better outcome.",valid

32152598,"Crosstalk between neighboring cells underlies many biological processes, including cell signaling, proliferation and differentiation. Current single-cell genomic technologies profile each cell separately after tissue dissociation, losing information on cell-cell interactions. In the present study, we present an approach for sequencing physically interacting cells (PIC-seq), which combines cell sorting of physically interacting cells (PICs) with single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using computational modeling, PIC-seq systematically maps in situ cellular interactions and characterizes their molecular crosstalk. We apply PIC-seq to interrogate diverse interactions including immune-epithelial PICs in neonatal murine lungs. Focusing on interactions between T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro and in vivo, we map T cell-DC interaction preferences, and discover regulatory T cells as a major T cell subtype interacting with DCs in mouse draining lymph nodes. Analysis of T cell-DC pairs reveals an interaction-specific program between pathogen-presenting migratory DCs and T cells. PIC-seq provides a direct and broadly applicable technology to characterize intercellular interaction-specific pathways at high resolution.",valid

Simultaneous trajectories of brain and behavior, however, are understudied, especially in these environmental contexts. In this four-wave study spanning 9-18 years of age (N=224 at baseline, N=138 at final assessment) we used longitudinal k-means clustering to identify clusters of participants with distinct trajectories of uncinate fasciculus (UF) fractional anisotropy (FA) and anxiety symptoms; we examined behavioral outcomes and identified environmental factors that predicted cluster membership. We identified three clusters of participants: 1) high UF FA and low symptoms (""low-risk""); 2) low UF FA and high symptoms (""high-risk""); and 3) low UF FA and low symptoms (""resilient""). Adolescents in disadvantaged neighborhoods were more likely to be in the resilient than high-risk cluster if they also experienced maternal warmth. Thus, neighborhood disadvantage may confer neural risk for psychopathology that can be buffered by maternal warmth, highlighting the importance of considering multiple environmental influences in understanding emotional and neural development in youth.",valid

While the subject matter of epidemiology in Spain shares many features with its neighbours in Western Europe, many aspects of epidemiology in Latin America are particular to that region. There are also distinctive theoretical and philosophical approaches to the study of epidemiology and public health arising from traditions such as the Latin American social medicine movement, of which there may be limited awareness. A number of online bibliographic databases are available which focus primarily on health sciences literature arising in Spain and Latin America, the most prominent being Literatura Latinoamericana en Ciencias de la Salud (LILACS) and LATINDEX. Some such as LILACS also extensively index grey literature. As well as in Spanish, interfaces are provided in English and Portuguese. Abstracts of articles may also be provided in English with an increasing number of journals beginning to publish entire articles written in English. Free full text articles are becoming accessible, one of the most comprehensive sources being the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO).

37095110,"Utilizing colloidal probe, lateral force microscopy and simultaneous confocal microscopy, combined with finite element analysis, we investigate how a microparticle starts moving laterally on a soft, adhesive surface. We find that the surface can form a self-contacting crease at the leading front, which results from a buildup of compressive stress. Experimentally, creases are observed on substrates that exhibit either high or low adhesion when measured in the normal direction, motivating the use of simulations to consider the role of adhesion energy and interfacial strength. Our simulations illustrate that the interfacial strength plays a dominating role in the nucleation of a crease. After the crease forms, it progresses through the contact zone in a Schallamach wave-like fashion. Interestingly, our results suggest that this Schallamach wave-like motion is facilitated by free slip at the adhesive, self-contacting interface within the crease.",valid
38224375,"As a novel imaging marker, pericoronary fat attenuation index (FAI) reflects the local coronary inflammation which is one of the major mechanisms for in-stent restenosis (ISR). We aimed to validate the ability of pericoronary FAI to predict ISR in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients who underwent coronary CT angiography (CCTA) before PCI within 1 week between January 2017 and December 2019 at our hospital and had follow-up invasive coronary angiography (ICA) or CCTA were enrolled. Pericoronary FAI was measured at the site where stents would be placed. ISR was defined as ≥ 50% diameter stenosis at follow-up ICA or CCTA in the in-stent area. Multivariable analysis using mixed effects logistic regression models was performed to test the association between pericoronary FAI and ISR at lesion level. A total of 126 patients with 180 target lesions were included in the study. During 22.5 months of mean interval time from index PCI to follow-up ICA or CCTA, ISR occurred in 40 (22.2%, 40/180) stents. Pericoronary FAI was associated with a higher risk of ISR (adjusted OR = 1.12, p = 0.028). The optimum cutoff was - 69.6 HU. Integrating the dichotomous pericoronary FAI into current state of the art prediction model for ISR improved the prediction ability of the model significantly (△area under the curve =  + 0.064; p = 0.001). Pericoronary FAI around lesions with subsequent stent placement is independently associated with ISR and could improve the ability of current prediction model for ISR. Pericoronary fat attenuation index can be used to identify the lesions with high risk for in-stent restenosis. These lesions may benefit from extra anti-inflammation treatment to avoid in-stent restenosis. • Pericoronary fat attenuation index reflects the local coronary inflammation. • Pericoronary fat attenuation index around lesions with subsequent stents placement can predict in-stent restenosis. • Pericoronary fat attenuation index can be used as a marker for future in-stent restenosis.",valid
28699041,"Prophylactic treatment has been proved to reduce hypotension incidence after spinal anesthesia during cesarean labor. However, the use of pharmacological prophylaxis could carry out undesirable side-effects on mother and fetus. Thus, the prediction of hypotension becomes an important challenge. Hypotension events are hypothesized to be related to a malfunctioning of autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation of blood pressure. In this work, ANS responses to positional changes of 51 pregnant women programmed for a cesarean labor were explored for hypotension prediction. Lateral and supine decubitus, and sitting position were considered while electrocardiographic and pulse photoplethysmographic signals were recorded. Features based on heart rate variability, pulse rate variability (PRV) and pulse transit time (PTT) analysis were used in a logistic regression classifier. The results showed that PRV irregularity changes, assessed by approximate entropy, from supine to lateral decubitus, and standard deviation of PTT in supine decubitus were found as the combination of features that achieved the best classification results sensitivity of 76%, specificity of 70% and accuracy of 72%, being normotensive the positive class. Peripheral regulation and blood pressure changes, measured by PRV and PTT analysis, could help to predict hypotension events reducing prophylactic side-effects in the low-risk population.",valid

All of the Bacteroides fragilis group and 51% of the non-Bacteroides fragilis group were beta-lactamase positive. Amongst the non-Bacteroides fragilis group, beta-lactamase positivity rates were higher for US strains (58%) than for European strains (39%). All strains were susceptible to imipenem and metronidazole. MIC90s of amoxicillin and ticarcillin for all beta-lactamase negative strains were 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The addition of clavulanate reduced the MIC90s of amoxicillin (> or = 256 micrograms/ml) and ticarcillin (> or = 64 micrograms/ml) to 16 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the Bacteroides fragilis group, and to 4 micrograms/ml for both agents for the non-Bacteroides fragilis beta-lactamase producing group. Twenty-nine cefoxitin-resistant strains were found, mainly in the Bacteroides fragilis group, while 95 beta-lactamase producing strains (predominantly Bacteroides fragilis group and fusobacteria) did not show synergy between beta-lactams and clavulanate. Of the newe agents tested, meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active (100% of strains susceptible), followed by amoxicillin-BRL 42715 (99% of strains susceptible); 94 to 98% of the strains were susceptible to cefoperazone-sulbactam, tosufloxacin, temafloxacin and clindamycin. Only 73% of the strains were susceptible to cefotetan, compared to 91% to cefoxitin; 88% of the strains were susceptible to trospectomycin.

38001396,"Amphibian species have the largest genome size enriched with repetitive sequences and relatively similar karyotypes. Moreover, many amphibian species frequently hybridize causing nuclear and mitochondrial genome introgressions. In addition, hybridization in some amphibian species may lead to clonality and polyploidization. All such events were found in water frogs from the genus Pelophylax. Among the species within the genus Pelophylax, P. esculentus complex is the most widely distributed and well-studied. This complex includes two parental species, P. ridibundus and P. lessonae, and their hybrids, P. esculentus, reproducing hemiclonally. Parental species and their hybrids have similar but slightly polymorphic karyotypes, so their precise identification is still required. Here, we have developed a complete set of 13 chromosome painting probes for two parental species allowing the precise identification of all chromosomes. Applying chromosomal painting, we identified homologous chromosomes in both parental species and orthologous chromosomes in their diploid hemiclonal hybrids. Comparative painting did not reveal interchromosomal exchanges between the studied water frog species and their hybrids. Using cross-specific chromosome painting, we detected unequal distribution of the signals along chromosomes suggesting the presence of species-specific tandem repeats. Application of chromosomal paints to the karyotypes of hybrids revealed differences in the intensity of staining for P. ridibundus and P. lessonae chromosomes. Thus, both parental genomes have a divergence in unique sequences. Obtained chromosome probes may serve as a powerful tool to unravel chromosomal evolution in phylogenetically related species, identify individual chromosomes in different cell types, and investigate the elimination of chromosomes in hybrid water frogs.",valid

35208392,"The vision chip is widely used to acquire and process images. It connects the image sensor directly with the vision processing unit (VPU) to execute the vision tasks. Modern vision tasks mainly consist of image signal processing (ISP) algorithms and deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the traditional VPUs are unsuitable for the DNNs, and the DNN processing units (DNPUs) cannot process the ISP algorithms. Meanwhile, only the CNNs and the CNN-RNN frameworks are used in the vision tasks, and few DNPUs are specifically designed for this. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous architecture for the VPU with a hybrid accelerator for the DNNs. It can process the ISP, CNNs, and hybrid DNN subtasks on one unit. Furthermore, we present a sharing scheme to multiplex the hardware resources for different subtasks. We also adopt a pipelined workflow for the vision tasks to fully use the different processing modules and achieve a high processing speed. We implement the proposed VPU on the field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and several vision tasks are tested on it. The experiment results show that our design can process the vision tasks efficiently with an average performance of 22.6 giga operations per second/W (GOPS/W).",valid

There is paucity of data regarding expression of nuclear receptors and factors in salivary glands. In the present study, a focus was placed on human parotid gland expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Parotid salivary tissue was obtained from patients undergoing the gland dissection. Quantitative real-time PCR aimmunohistochemical staining were used for expression studies. The highest mRNA expression was documented for NFE2L2 coding for Nrf2. Lower expression was seen in the case of AHR gene coding for AhR. PXR was constitutively present at very low level and CAR expression was below the limit of quantification. Immunohistochemical evaluation of the parotid gland specimens revealed cytoplasmic Nrf2 expression in striated duct cells as well as within myoepithelial cells. Acinar cells were mostly negative for Nrf2. Expression of AhR was found within the cytoplasm in striated duct cells. Acinar and myoepithelial cells were negative for AhR.

One glycoprotein of Mr approximately 1.3 X 10(5) and pI approximately 4.8 (gp130) is present in intact retinas and, in the presence of Ca2+, is both resistant to tryptic cleavage and poorly iodinated. When cultured in vitro, iodinated retinas release into the medium a number of iodinated polypeptides; one of the major iodinated components is a polypeptide of Mr approximately 9 X 10(4) and pI approximately 4.8 (gp90). This component is also resistant to tryptic cleavage in the presence of Ca2+. Two-dimensional peptide maps of gp130 and gp90 derived respectively from iodinated retinas and their conditioned media are very similar. Maps of samples reiodinated following denaturation show the same similarities as well as additional labeled peptides. Furthermore, the two-dimensional peptide maps of the two molecules prepared from retinas cultured in the presence of [3H]glucosamine are identical. We conclude that gp90 is a turnover fragment of gp130 and comprises that portion of gp130 exposed at the cell surface.

25961880,"It is commonly assumed that attentional inhibitory functioning decreases with age, even though empirical evidence is mixed. These inconsistencies possibly stem from methodological artifacts: distractor inhibition is typically assessed with the negative priming paradigm, which confounds inhibition and episodic retrieval. In the present study, we investigated age differences in a sequential distractor repetition paradigm (Giesen, Frings, & Rothermund, 2012) that provides independent estimates of distractor inhibition and episodic retrieval processes. Older (60+ yrs) and younger (below 30 years) adults identified target letters that were flanked by distractors (JKJ). Inhibitory processes were preserved in older adults, who showed reliable distractor repetition benefits resulting from persistent distractor inhibition; however, a significant loss of inhibition was apparent for the older subgroup of participants (65+ yrs) compared with a subgroup of young-old participants (60 to 64 years). No age differences were found for episodic retrieval processes of stimulus-response bindings that were indexed by an interaction of distractor repetition and response relation. Findings highlight the importance of dissociating between distractor inhibition and retrieval processes that are differently implicated in age-related cognitive change.",valid

6487609,"Polyhistidine facilities the fusion of negatively charged liposomes prepared by sonication. Liposome fusion was demonstrated by (a) negative-stain electron microscopy, (b) gel filtration, and (c) resonance energy transfer of the fluorescent phospholipids. Liposome fusion required the presence of polyhistidine, whereas histidine at equivalent concentrations had no effect. Little or no liposome fusion was detectable at pH 7.4, but it was greatly enhanced when the pH of the medium was reduced below 6.5. Although acidic phospholipid is necessary for fusion, liposomes made of acidic lipids alone showed only low levels of fusion activity. Liposomes composed of mixtures (1:1) of a negatively charged phospholipid and a neutral phospholipid such as phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), but not sphingomyelin, showed high levels (about 80%) of fusion competency. For liposomes made of PE/phosphatidylserine (PS) (1:1), fusion at pH 5.2 and 2.5 micrograms/mL polyhistidine resulted in an increase in the average liposome diameter from 296 to 2400 A, indicating multiple rounds of fusion had occurred. Liposome fusion was not very leaky as revealed by the lack of release of encapsulated calcein. For PE/PS (1:1) liposomes, about 10% of dye leakage was observed for up to about 30% liposome fusion and about 45% leakage at 80% liposome fusion. Since polyhistidine becomes a strong polycation at acidic pH, liposome fusion may be a direct result of the bilayer phase separation induced by the binding of polyhistidine with the negatively charged phospholipids. Therefore, this phenomenon is similar to the liposome fusion induced by other polycations such as polylysine at neutral pH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",valid

Using markers at eight different microsatellite locl, we characterized one group of 34 left-sided sporadic CRCs as replication error negative (RER-) and another group of 18 left-sided sporadic CRCs as replication error positive (RER+). These tumors, together with a third group of 22 left-sided ulcerative-colitis-associated CRCs (UCACRCs), were then examined by immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2 overexpression.

Three surveys were undertaken in January of 1988, 1989 and 1990, determining parasitological prevalence, intensity of infection and morbidity and applying repeated targeted mass treatment. One dose of praziquantel (40 mg/kg body weight) was given one week after treatment with mebendazole (100 mg every 12 hours for 3 days). A reduction of the overall prevalence by S. intercalatum of 69.9% and 79.3% in the first and second year respectively was found. Persons showing high parasite burden suffered a reduction of 95.7%. The cure rate (no more eggs in stool) was between 90% and 98.9%. A significant decrease of signs and symptoms was observed. No important side effects were detected. This study shows the positive action of praziquantel in reducing prevalence, intensity of infection and morbidity due to S. intercalatum, above all in the case of a high human population participation response. Cure rates obtained being similar to the ones observed using the same drug in Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium.",valid
10564794,"Two classes of phage K20 resistant Escherichia coli K-12 mutants were obtained. One class of mutants possessed alterations within the ompF gene while the rfa gene cluster, which is responsible for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis, was affected in the second class of mutants. The OmpF mutants contained substitutions affecting residues localized within the surface-exposed loops 5, 6 or 7. A single deletion mutation resulted in the removal of eight residues of loop 5. These alterations prevented the binding of K20 to cell surface without affecting OmpF's channel activity. One LPS mutant characterized in detail contained an unusual aberration within the rfa gene cluster caused by an IS5 element. Its insertion mediated a deletion encompassing the rfaBIJ genes. Genetic complementation analysis revealed that the rfaB gene, whose product catalyzes the addition of a galactose residue to the first glucose molecule of the LPS core, is necessary to synthesize LPS able to serve as a co-receptor for phage K20.",valid

22219065,"There is increased interest in locoregional recurrences of rectal cancer. Despite comparable locoregional recurrence rates in colon cancer, only a few studies on locoregional recurrences among colon cancer patients have been published. This study was designed to identify prognostic factors for locoregional recurrences among patients with colon cancer in the Netherlands. The study population was composed of patients who underwent radical surgical resections for invasive colon carcinoma, diagnosed in three regions of the Netherlands from 2000 to 2003. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate 5-year locoregional recurrence rates (LRR). Conditional hazard rates were estimated by the life-table method. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors and to calculate a Locoregional Recurrence Risk Score (LRRS). In total 127 of 2,282 patients developed locoregional recurrences within 5 years (LRR 6.4%). The risk of developing a locoregional recurrence was highest at 0.5-1 year after surgery. Patients with left-sided tumors, T3-T4 tumors, and positive lymph nodes and those who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy were more likely to develop locoregional recurrences. Four risk groups based on the LRRS were defined. Five-year LRR was 2.5% for the very low-risk group and 25.1% for the high-risk group. Although the locoregional recurrence rate in this study was relatively low, it remains a considerable problem. Identifying individual patients who might benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy may reduce the locoregional recurrence rate.",valid
22748389,"The removal of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) from solid matrices has received considerable attention because of the environmental persistence, bioaccumulation, and potential toxicity of these compounds. This study presents a simple method using concentrated HNO(3) as a suppression agent, and methanol-modified supercritical carbon dioxide (Sc-CO(2)) extraction for removing PFOS and PFOA from solid matrices. The optimal conditions were 16 M HNO(3) and 20% (v/v) methanol containing Sc-CO(2), under a pressure of 20.3 MPa and a temperature of 50 °C. Extraction time was set at 70 min (40 min for static and 30 min for dynamic extraction). PFOA and PFOS were identified and quantitated by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The extraction efficiencies (with double extractions) were close to 100% for PFOA and 80% for PFOS for both paper and fabric matrices. The extraction efficiencies for sand were approximately 77% for PFOA and 59% for PFOS. The results show that this method is accurate, and effective, and that it provides a promising and convenient approach to remediate the environment of hazardous PFOA and PFOS contamination.",valid

To explore the insertion site of MMTVLTR in TA2 mouse genome, reverse PCR and nested PCR were used to amplify the unknown sequence on both sides of the MMTV-LTRSAG gene in SBC and normal breast tissue of TA2 mice. Furthermore, the clinicopathological significance of the insertion site was evaluated in 43 samples of normal breast tissue, 46 samples of breast cystic hyperplasia, 54 samples of ductal carcinoma in situ, 142 samples of primary breast cancer and 47 samples of lymph node metastatic breast cancer by RNA in situ hybridization. We confirmed that the insertion site of the MMTV-LTRSAG gene was located between Igκv2-112 and Igκv14-111 in chromosome 6 of TA2 mouse. IGκC was localized in the stromal cells of TA2 mouse with SBC and in human breast cancer tissues. Tumor cells were negative for IGκC in RNA in situ hybridization. The positive staining index of IGκC in stromal cells was the highest in lymph node metastatic breast cancer, followed by primary breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, and breast cystic hyperplasia. Furthermore, the positive staining index of IGκC was related to the expression of ER, PR, HER2 and Ki-67. Our findings showed that stromal IGκC expression was associated with the initiation of SBC in TA2 mice.

Our objective was to estimate the time needed to perform resuscitation with a drone-delivered AED and to measure cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) quality. Mock out-of-hospital cardiac arrest simulations that included a 9-1-1 call, CPR, and drone-delivered AED were conducted. Each simulation was timed and video-recorded. CPR performance metrics were recorded by a Laerdal Resusci Anne Quality Feedback System. Multivariable regression modeling examined factors associated with time from 9-1-1 call to AED shock and CPR quality metrics (compression rate, depth, recoil, and chest compression fraction). Comparisons were made among those with recent CPR training (≤2 years) versus no recent (>2 years) or prior CPR training. We recruited 51 research participants between September 2019 and March 2020. The median age was 34 (Q1-Q3, 23-54) years, 56.9% were female, and 41.2% had recent CPR training. The median time from 9-1-1 call to initiation of CPR was 1:19 (Q1-Q3, 1:06-1:26) minutes. A median time of 1:59 (Q1-Q3, 01:50-02:20) minutes was needed to retrieve a drone-delivered AED and deliver a shock.

Analysis of the sensitivity and resolution parameters derived from the electrochemical response of such films indicates that PEDOT is the most appropriate for the unambiguous detection of the three species. Indeed, the performance of PEDOT is practically independent of the presence of both gold nanoparticles at the surface of the film and interphases inside the film, even though these two factors are known to improve the electroactivity of conducting polymers. Quantum mechanical calculations on model complexes have been used to examine the intermolecular interaction involved in complexes formed by PEDOT chains and oxidized dopamine, ascorbic acid and uric acid. Results show that such complexes are mainly stabilized by C-HO interactions rather than by conventional hydrogen bonds. In order to improve the sensitivity of PEDOT through the formation of specific hydrogen bonds, a derivative bearing a hydroxymethyl group attached to the dioxane ring of each repeat unit has been designed.

Using both independent component analysis and dual regression, subject-specific time courses of 12 RSFNs were extracted from both 20 medication-naïve children with ADHD, and 20 age and gender-matched control children showing typical development (TDC). Both partial correlation coefficients among the 12 RSFNs and a resting-state resource allocation index (rsRAI) of the salience network (SN) were entered into multiple linear regression analysis to investigate the compromised, age-related change in medication-naïve ADHD children. Finally, correlation analyses were performed between the compromised RSFN connections showing significant group-by-age interaction and rsRAI of SN or clinical variables. Medication-naïve ADHD subjects failed to show age-related increment of functional connectivity in both rsRAI of SN and two RSFN connections, SN-Sensory/motor and posterior default mode/precuneus network (pDMN/prec)--anterior DMN. Lower SN-Sensory/motor connectivity was related with higher scores on the ADHD Rating Scale, and with poor scores on the continuous performance test. The pDMN/prec-aDMN connectivity was positively related with rsRAI of SN.

The origins of salivary IGF-I concentrations were studied. Intracardial administration of Sprague-Dawley rats with 125I-labelled IGF-I and subsequent analysis of plasma and saliva samples by exclusion gel chromatography and SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography, demonstrated the apparent inability of IGF-I to cross from the plasma pool through to saliva. 125I-Labelled IGF-I was not chromatographed immediately before injection, resulting in administration of free iodide along with the iodinated peptide. This free iodide was demonstrable in saliva, indicating that movement of substances from plasma to saliva was measurable using the levels of 125I activity administered. Free iodide in saliva was not contributed to by 125I-labelled IGF-I degradation since 125I-labelled IGF-I was shown to be stable in saliva over 24 h.

Considering the articulating joint as an organ it would be beneficial to include more complex stimulation. Within this study we applied clinically relevant kinematic load to biphasic constructs. In each case, the upper layer consisted of fibrin embedded hMSCs retained within an elastomeric polyurethane (PU) scaffold. These were randomly assigned to five base scaffolds, a cell-free fibrin PU base, viable bone, decellularized bone, 3D printed calcium phosphate or clinically used cement. This allowed the study of cross talk between viable bone and chondrogenically differentiating MSCs, while controlling for the change in stiffness of the base material. Data obtained showed that the bulk stiffness of the construct was not the defining factor in the response obtained, with viable and decellularized bone producing similar results to the softer PU base. However, the stiff synthetic materials led to reduced chondrogenesis and increased calcification in the upper MSC seeded layer. This demonstrates that the underlying base material must be considered when driving chondrogenesis of human cells using a clinically relevant loading protocol.

21372322,"Deinococcus radiodurans is a robust bacterium best known for its capacity to repair massive DNA damage efficiently and accurately. It is extremely resistant to many DNA-damaging agents, including ionizing radiation and UV radiation (100 to 295 nm), desiccation, and mitomycin C, which induce oxidative damage not only to DNA but also to all cellular macromolecules via the production of reactive oxygen species. The extreme resilience of D. radiodurans to oxidative stress is imparted synergistically by an efficient protection of proteins against oxidative stress and an efficient DNA repair mechanism, enhanced by functional redundancies in both systems. D. radiodurans assets for the prevention of and recovery from oxidative stress are extensively reviewed here. Radiation- and desiccation-resistant bacteria such as D. radiodurans have substantially lower protein oxidation levels than do sensitive bacteria but have similar yields of DNA double-strand breaks. These findings challenge the concept of DNA as the primary target of radiation toxicity while advancing protein damage, and the protection of proteins against oxidative damage, as a new paradigm of radiation toxicity and survival. The protection of DNA repair and other proteins against oxidative damage is imparted by enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defense systems dominated by divalent manganese complexes. Given that oxidative stress caused by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species is associated with aging and cancer, a comprehensive outlook on D. radiodurans strategies of combating oxidative stress may open new avenues for antiaging and anticancer treatments. The study of the antioxidation protection in D. radiodurans is therefore of considerable potential interest for medicine and public health.",valid
35418340,"Musculoskeletal injuries are common, and peripheral nerve injury (PNI) causes significant muscle and bone loss within weeks. After PNI, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) improves functional recovery and muscle atrophy. However, it is unknown whether 4-AP has any effect on isolated traumatic muscle injury and PNI-induced bone loss. A standardized crush injury was performed on the sciatic nerve and muscles in mice, and the mice were assigned to receive normal saline or 4-AP treatment daily for 21 days. The postinjury motor and sensory function recovery was assessed, injured muscles were processed for histomorphometry, and the tibial bone was scanned for bone density. 4-Aminopyridine significantly accelerated the postinjury motor and sensory function recovery, improved muscle histomorphometry, increased muscle satellite cell numbers, and shifted muscle fiber types after combined nerve and muscle injury. Importantly, the 4-AP treatment significantly reduced PNI-induced bone loss. In contrast, in the case of isolated muscle injury, 4-AP had no effect on functional recovery and bone density, but it improved muscle-specific histomorphometry to a limited extent. These findings demonstrate the potential beneficial effects of 4-AP on the recovery of muscle morphology and bone density after combined muscle and nerve injury. Nerve injuries frequently involve muscle and result in rapid muscle and bone atrophy. In this scenario, 4-AP, in addition to accelerating nerve functional recovery, might work as an adjunctive agent to improve the recovery of injured muscle and attenuate PNI-induced bone loss.",valid

Adenosine and the stable adenosine analogues 5'-(N-ethyl)carboxamido adenosine (NECA) and (-)-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA) produced a concentration-dependent direct negative inotropic effect. Responses to NECA and R-PIA were insensitive to atropine and were shifted to the right by the adenosine receptor antagonist 3-isobutyl-1-methyl xanthine (IBMX). NECA and R-PIA were found to reverse positive inotropic responses of left atria to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol, but were less effective at reversing positive inotropic responses to the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, and were almost ineffective at reversing positive inotropic responses to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation. Neither NECA nor R-PIA had a significant effect on basal cAMP levels or on cAMP levels elevated by isoproterenol in rabbit left atria. Similarly, R-PIA had no significant effect on basal cAMP levels or isoproterenol-induced increases in cAMP in the presence of adenosine deaminase to remove the influence of endogenous adenosine. Pretreatment of rabbits with 1.75 micrograms/kg pertussis toxin attenuated both the direct negative inotropic response of left atria to NECA and responses to NECA in the presence of isoproterenol and forskolin to a similar extent. Pretreatment of left atrial preparations with the potassium channel antagonist 4-aminopyridine resulted in a dose dependent attenuation of responses to NECA alone and in the presence of isoproterenol and forskolin.

Urine electrolyte concentrations were measured using a commercial chemistry analyzer and UAG was calculated as ([sodium] + [potassium]) - [chloride]. Urine ammonia and creatinine concentrations had been measured previously using commercially available enzymatic assays and used to calculate UACR. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between UAG and UACR was calculated for both groups. The UAG values of healthy cats and cats with CKD were assessed using the Mann-Whitney test (P < .05). The UAG was inversely correlated with UACR in healthy cats (P < .002, r The UAG calculation cannot be used as a substitute for UACR in cats. The clinical relevance of UAG differences between healthy cats and those with CKD remains unknown.",valid
36149551,"In the present study, biomass from the Chromolaena odorata plant's stem was activated using sulfuric acid to adsorb crystal violet (CV) dye. The adsorption operation of CV dye was studied considering the effect of variables like pH, initial dye concentration, time, adsorbent dosage, and temperature. The pseudo-second-order equation best fitted the kinetic study. The thermodynamic parameters such as activation energy (9.56 kJ/mol), change in Gibbs energy (81.43 to 96.7 kJ/mol), enthalpy change (6.89 kJ/mol), and entropy change (-254.4 J/mol K) were calculated. Response surface methodology estimated that at pH (4.902), adsorbent dosage (8.33 g/L), dye concentration (82.30 ppm), and temperature (300.13 K) dye removal of 97.53% is possible. FTIR, SEM, XRD, BJH, and BET confirmed adsorption operation. The adsorbent can be reused for 3 cycles effectively. Langmuir isotherm which best fitted the adsorption operation was used for designing a theoretical single-stage batch adsorber for large-scale operation.",valid

27794455,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection can induce neurocognitive complications classified as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). The chitinase family is associated with innate immunity cells and many infectious diseases. We analyzed microarray datasets obtained from NCBI in order to verify the expression of chitinase family genes in hippocampus of uninfected rhesus macaques versus those with histopathologic evidence of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Encephalitis (SIVE). Moreover, we have analysed two human microarray datasets to verify the results obtained in macaques hippocampus affected by SIVE. For these studies, we have also used the open source tools Genome-scale Integrated Analysis of gene Networks in Tissues (GIANT) to identify the chitinase genes network. CHIT1, CHI3L1 and CHI3L2 levels were significantly increased in SIVE hippocampus as compared to non-infected control specimens. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between CHIA vs. Brain Viral Load (BVL). These data was confirmed partially in human brain section of HAD/HIVE subjects. Also, we showed that HIV-1 was able to modulate the expression of CHIT1, CHI3L1, CHI3L2 and CHID1 in human macrophages. These results suggest that chitinase gene expression is altered in SIVE and in HAD/HIVE brain sections and call for more studies examining whether this is a protective immunological reaction or a destructive tissue response to encephalitis.",valid

We find analytical expressions for the main topological properties of these models as a function of the distribution of hidden variables and the probability of connecting vertices. The expressions obtained are checked by means of numerical simulations in a particular example. The general model is extended to describe a practical algorithm to generate random networks with an a priori specified correlation structure. We also present an extension of the class, to map nonequilibrium growing networks to networks with hidden variables that represent the time at which each vertex was introduced in the system.",valid
37644838,"Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 through to mid-2021, much of the Australian population lived in a COVID-19-free environment. This followed the broadly successful implementation of a strong suppression strategy, including international border closures. With the availability of COVID-19 vaccines in early 2021, the national government sought to transition from a state of minimal incidence and strong suppression activities to one of high vaccine coverage and reduced restrictions but with still-manageable transmission. This transition is articulated in the national 're-opening' plan released in July 2021. Here, we report on the dynamic modelling study that directly informed policies within the national re-opening plan including the identification of priority age groups for vaccination, target vaccine coverage thresholds and the anticipated requirements for continued public health measures-assuming circulation of the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. Our findings demonstrated that adult vaccine coverage needed to be at least 60% to minimize public health and clinical impacts following the establishment of community transmission. They also supported the need for continued application of test-trace-isolate-quarantine and social measures during the vaccine roll-out phase and beyond.",valid
26230144,"Pt(II) dbbpy bisacetylide (dbbpy = 4,4'-di(tert-butyl)-2,2'-bipyridine) complex (Pt-1) with two different Bodipy ligands was prepared with the goal to attain broad-band visible light absorbing, efficient funneling of the photoexcitation energy (via resonance energy transfer, RET) to the energy acceptor and high triplet formation quantum yields. Construction of the above-mentioned molecular structural motif is challenging because two different arylacetylide ligands are incorporated in the complex; normally two homoleptic acetylide ligands were used for this kind of N(∧)N Pt(II) complexes. A reference complex with trans bis(tributylphosphine) Pt(II) bisacetylide protocol (Pt-4) was prepared for comparison of the photophysical properties. The two different Bodipy ligands in Pt-1 and Pt-4 constitute singlet/triplet energy donor/acceptor, as a result the harvested photoexcitation energy can be funneled to the triplet state confined on one of the two Bodipy ligands. The photophysical properties of the complexes were studied with steady state UV-vis absorption and luminescence spectroscopies, femto- and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry, as well as DFT/TDDFT calculations. Fluorescence/phosphorescence dual emission were observed for the complex. The ultrafast intramolecular singlet/triplet energy transfer in Pt-1 was confirmed by the transient absorption spectroscopy (kFRET = 2.6 × 10(11) s(-1), ΦFRET = 87.1%) followed by an intersystem crossing (kISC = 1.9 × 10(10) s(-1)), and the triplet state lifetime (τT) is 54.1 μs.

22071042,"To describe the differences in characteristics and outcome between two consecutive series of patients admitted to hospital with chest pain in a 20-year perspective. Particular emphasis is placed on changes in outcome in relation to the initial electrocardiogram (ECG). In the two periods, 1986-1987 and 2008, all patients with chest pain admitted to the study hospitals in Gothenburg, Sweden, were included. Five thousand and sixteen patients were registered in a period of 21 months in 1986-1987 and 2287 patients were registered during 3 months in 2008. In a comparison of the two time periods, the age of chest pain patients was not significantly different (mean age 60.1 ± 17.8 years in 1986-1987 and 59.8 ± 19.1 years in 2008, p=0.50). There was a lower prevalence of previous angina pectoris, congestive heart failure and current smoking in the second period, whereas a history of acute myocardial infarction, hypertension and diabetes mellitus had become more prevalent. The use of cardio-protective drugs increased and ECG changes indicating acute myocardial ischemia on admission to hospital decreased. Length of hospitalisation was reduced from a median of 5 days to 3 days (p<0.0001). A significant decrease in 30-day and 1-year mortality was found (3.8% in 1986-1987 vs 2.0% in 2008 and 9.9% vs 6.3% respectively, p<0.0001 for both comparisons). During a period of 20 years, the characteristics and outcome of patients admitted to hospital with chest pain changed. The most important changes were a lower prevalence of ECG signs indicating acute myocardial ischemia on admission, shorter hospitalisation time and a lower 30-day and 1-year mortality.",valid

7886938,"Contrary to a previous report, electron microscopic studies on the Fny strain of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-infected tobacco tissues revealed that plasmodesmata were not structurally modified during CMV infection, nor were virions ever observed in plasmodesmata connecting infected cells. To further explore the basis of CMV infection, experiments were performed on the CMV 3a ORF. The 3a protein of CMV was expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli. The purified protein was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and subsequently microinjected into mesophyll cells of mature leaves of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Turkish Samsun NN. Within a brief period (as little as 1 sec), the microinjected FITC-labeled CMV 3a protein moved into neighboring cells. Co-injection of unlabeled CMV 3a protein with 9.4-kDa fluorescein-conjugated dextran (F-dextran) resulted in extensive cell-to-cell movement (diffusion) of the F-dextran, indicating that the 3a protein can interact with and dilate plasmodesmata. Furthermore, co-injection of unlabeled 3a protein with fluorescently labeled infectious CMV RNA molecules resulted in rapid and extensive cell-to-cell transport. In contrast, a mutant form of the 3a protein was unable to traffic from cell to cell, to increase the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata, or to potentiate cell-to-cell trafficking of CMV RNA molecules. Microinjection studies performed on transgenic tobacco plants expressing the CMV 3a protein indicated that fluorescently labeled CMV RNA moved out of the target cell into the surrounding mesophyll tissue. In addition, expression of the CMV 3a protein also potentiated the cell-to-cell movement of 9.4-kDa F-dextran. Collectively, these results provide direct experimental evidence that the CMV 3a protein functions as the movement protein of CMV. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that CMV moves from cell-to-cell in the form of a ribonucleoprotein complex.",valid

976261,"In order to elucidate the mechanism of action of inhibitors that block the initiation of protein synthesis in mammalian systems, we have studied the following steps: (a) formation of the ternary complex Met-tRNAr-IF-E2-GTP, (b) binding of the initiator Met-tRNAf to the 40-S ribosomal subunit in the presence of initiation factors and dependent or not on the addition of mRNA, (c) formation of the initiation complex with 80-S ribosomes and (d) formation of the first peptide bond. Adrenochrome, aurintricarboxylic acid, polydextran sulphate, pyrochatechol violet and showdomycin block the formation of the ternary complex Met-tRNAf-IF-E2-GTP. Edeine A1, aurintricarboxylic acid and polydextran sulphate block the binding of the mRNA to the 40-S ribosomal subunit. Pactamycin induces the formation of stable smaller initiation complexes which are unable to go through the subsequent steps of initiation. Stimulation of the binding of the initiator Met-tRNAf to the 80-S ribosome in the presence of initiation factors is observed with sparsomycin and antibiotics of the sesquiterpene family (verrucarin A, trichodermin and trichothecin). However, these antibiotics block the reaction of the bound Met-tRNAf with puromycin. Narciclasine has no effect on the binding of the initiator to the ribosome but strongly blocks its reaction with puromycin. We have developed a simple technique to detect the Met-tRNAf-40-S-subunit-poly(A, G, U) initiation complexes by chromatography on Sepharose 6B columns. The requirements for the formation of such complexes measured by this technique and its comparison with the sucrose gradient centrifugation method are described.",valid

Recent epidemiological reports have shown that despite fairly low self-reported prevalence of these disorders in large population studies, when validated smell identification or threshold tests are used they reveal quite a high prevalence of hyposmia and anosmia in certain groups, especially the elderly. Several different pathophysiological processes, such as head trauma, aging, autoimmunity, and toxic exposures, can contribute to smell impairment, with distinct implications concerning prognosis and possible treatment. Otolaryngologists are most likely to see this symptom in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, and this now appears to be caused more by the mucosal inflammation than by physical airway obstruction.",valid

We aimed to validate an existing composite score (Health Assessment Tool [HAT]) and provide provisional age-specific reference curves for the general older population. Data came from the Swedish National study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (N = 3,363 participants aged 60 years and over examined clinically at baseline and 3 years later). HAT was validated by exploring its relationship with health indicators (logistic regression) and comparing its ability to predict care consumption with that of two of its components, morbidity and disability (receiver operating characteristic curve areas). A flowchart was developed to obtain individual-level HAT scores (nominal response method). Sex-specific health charts were derived by graphing seven percentile curves of age-related HAT change (logistic quantile regression). HAT scores above the age- and sex-specific median were related to good performance in chair-stand tests (odds ratio [OR] = 2.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.07-3.31), balance and grip tests (interaction balance grip test, OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.05-1.25), and good self-rated health (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.77-2.71). Receiver operating characteristic curve areas (HAT vs number of chronic disorders) were formal care, 0.76 versus 0.58 (p value < .001); informal care, 0.74 versus 0.59 (p value < .001); hospital admission, 0.70 versus 0.66 (p value < .001); primary care visits, 0.71 versus 0.69 (p value > .05); and specialty care visits, 0.62 versus 0.65 (p value < .001).

The simulation is performed for the stoichiometric composition at a temperature of 1500 K, just below the melting temperature of the film model. It is found that the (110) surface is structurally stable but develops adatoms, vacancies and antisites. The coverage of an adatom layer is estimated to be ∼0.07 ML (monatomic layers) and it contains on average ∼95% of Al atoms. The top (surface) and second (subsurface) layers of the (110) surface is the most enriched in Ni relative to the bulk composition. These layers contain on average ∼51% of Ni atoms. The Ni fraction in the third and forth layers of the film is estimated as ∼50.5%. The deeper layers have essentially the bulk composition. Vacancies in the film model are found only on the Ni sublattice. The vacancy concentration on the Ni sublattice in the top layer is ∼7.5%. The second layer almost does not contain vacancies.

30672598,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation (LT). Although LT is associated with dyslipidemia, particularly atherogenic lipoprotein subparticles, the impact of these subparticles on CVD-related events is unknown. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the impact of small dense (sdLDL-C) low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) on CVD events. Prospectively enrolled patients (N = 130) had detailed lipid profile consisting of traditional lipid parameters and sdLDL-C and were followed for CVD events. The primary endpoint was a CVD composite consisting of myocardial infarction (MI), angina, need for coronary revascularization, and cardiac death. Mean age of the cohort was 58 ± 11 years, and the most common etiology of liver disease (LD) was hepatitis C virus (N = 48) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (N = 23). A total of 20 CVD events were noted after median follow-up of 45 months. The baseline traditional profile was similar in patients with and without CVD events. A serum LDL-C cutoff of 100 mg/dL was unable to identify individuals at risk of a CVD event (P = 0.86). In contrast, serum concentration of atherogenic sdLDL-C >25 mg/dL was predictive of CVD events with a hazard ratio of 6.376 (95% confidence interval, 2.65, 15.34; P < 0.001). This relationship was independent of diabetes, hypertension, sex, ethnicity, LD, obesity, and statin use. Conclusion: sdLDL-C independently predicted CVD events whereas LDL-C did not. Thus, sdLDL-C may provide a useful clinical tool in risk stratifying and managing patients after LT.",valid

An Inv/Mxi-Spa-like type III protein secretion apparatus, encoded by the B. pseudomallei bsa locus, facilitates bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, escape from endocytic vesicles and intracellular survival. This study investigated the role of the Bsa type III secretion system in the pathogenesis of melioidosis in murine models. B. pseudomallei bipD mutants, lacking a component of the translocation apparatus, were found to be significantly attenuated following intraperitoneal or intranasal challenge of BALB/c mice. Furthermore, a bipD mutant was attenuated in C57BL/6 IL-12 p40(-/-) mice, which are highly susceptible to B. pseudomallei infection. Mutation of bipD impaired bacterial replication in the liver and spleen of BALB/c mice in the early stages of infection. B. pseudomallei mutants lacking either the type III secreted guanine nucleotide exchange factor BopE or the putative effectors BopA or BopB exhibited varying degrees of attenuation, with mutations in bopA and bopB causing a significant delay in median time to death. This indicates that bsa-encoded type III secreted proteins may act in concert to determine the outcome of B. pseudomallei infection in mice. Mice inoculated with the B. pseudomallei bipD mutant were partially protected against subsequent challenge with wild-type B. pseudomallei.

37626242,"The identification of highly toxic metals like Cd, Ni, Pb, Cr, Co or Cu in ambient particulate matter (PM) has garnered a lot of interest recently. Exposure to toxic metals, including carcinogenic ones, at levels above recommended limits, can significantly affect human health. Prolonged exposure to even trace amounts of toxic or essential metals can also have negative health impacts. In order to assess significant risks, it is crucial to govern the concentrations of bioavailable/bio-accessible metals that are available in PM. Estimating the total metal concentrations in PM is only an approximation of metal toxicity. This review provides an overview of various procedures for extracting soluble toxic metals from PM and the importance of chemical fractionation in risk assessment. It is observed that the environmental risk indices such as bioavailability index (BI), contamination factor (CF) and risk assessment code (RAC) are specifically influenced by the concentration of these metals in a particular fraction. Additionally, there is compelling evidence that health risks assessed using total metal concentrations may be overestimated, therefore, the metal toxicity assessment is more accurate and more sensitive to the concentration of the bioavailable/bio-accessible fraction than the total metal concentrations. Hence, chemical fractionation of toxic metals can serve as an effective tool for developing environmental protection laws and improving air quality monitoring programs for public health.",valid

The linear range of this method is 0.0104-2.08 pg spot(-1) (corresponding concentration: 0.026-5.2 ng ml(-1), with a sample volume of 0.4 microl) with a detection limit (L.D.) of 2.6 fg spot(-1) (corresponding concentration: 6.5 x 10(-12) g ml(-1)), and the regression equation of working curve is DeltaIp = 2.040 + 54.54 m(TBS) (pg spot(-1)), n = 6, correlation coefficient is 0.9994. For the samples containing 0.0104 pg spot(-1) and 2.08 pg spot(-1) TBS, the relative standard deviation (RSD) are 3.8% and 2.3% (n = 8), respectively, indicating good precision. This method has been applied to determination of trace TBS in the practical samples with satisfactory results. The reaction mechanism of NaIO(4) oxidizing Rh 6G to inhibit SS-RTP for the determination of trace TBS is also discussed.",valid
38159554,"Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is commonly observed in atherosclerotic plaques, which is a pathogenic factor for severe coronary artery disease (CAD). The phenotype changes of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are found to participate in CAC progression, which is mainly induced by vascular inflammation and oxidative stress (OS). HMGB1, a critical inflammatory cytokine, is recently reported to induce arterial calcification, which is regulated by the Caspase-3/gasdermin-E (GSDME) axis. However, the function of the Caspase-3/GSDME axis in CAC is unknown. Herein, the involvement of the Caspase-3/GSDME axis in CAC was studied to explore the possible targets for CAC. CAC model was constructed in mice, which was verified by red cytoplasm in coronary artery tissues, increased macrophage infiltration, aggravated inflammation, and enhanced RAGE signaling, accompanied by an increased release of HMGB1 and an activated Caspase-3/ GSDME axis. In β-GP-treated MOVAS-1 cells, calcification, the ROS accumulation, enhanced LDH and HMGB1 release, enlarged macrophage production, aggravated inflammation, and activated RAGE signaling were observed, which were markedly abolished by the transfection of si-HMGB1 and si-GSDME. Moreover, the calcification deposition, the activity of Caspase-3/ GSDME axis, release of HMGB1, macrophage infiltration, cytokine production, and RAGE signaling in CAC mice were notably alleviated by VSMCs-specific GSDME knockdown, not by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)-specific GSDME knockdown. Collectively, Caspase-3/GSDME axis facilitated the progression of CAC by inducing the release of HMGB1.",valid
21858817,"The adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A) R) is a potential drug target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders. In rodents, the therapeutic efficacy of A(2A) R modulation is improved by concomitant modulation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). To elucidate the anatomical substrate(s) through which these therapeutic benefits could be mediated, pre-embedding electron microscopy immunohistochemistry was used to conduct a detailed, quantitative ultrastructural analysis of A(2A) R localization in the primate basal ganglia and to assess the degree of A(2A) R/mGluR5 colocalization in the striatum. A(2A) R immunoreactivity was found at the highest levels in the striatum and external globus pallidus (GPe). However, the monkey, but not the rat, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) also harbored a significant level of neuropil A(2A) R immunoreactivity. At the electron microscopic level, striatal A(2A) R labeling was most commonly localized in postsynaptic elements (58% ± 3% of labeled elements), whereas, in the GPe and SNr, the labeling was mainly presynaptic (71% ± 5%) or glial (27% ± 6%). In both striatal and pallidal structures, putative inhibitory and excitatory terminals displayed A(2A) R immunoreactivity. Striatal A(2A) R/mGluR5 colocalization was commonly found; 60-70% of A(2A) R-immunoreactive dendrites or spines in the monkey striatum coexpress mGluR5. These findings provide the first detailed account of the ultrastructural localization of A(2A) R in the primate basal ganglia and demonstrate that A(2A) R and mGluR5 are located to interact functionally in dendrites and spines of striatal neurons. Together, these data foster a deeper understanding of the substrates through which A(2A) R could regulate primate basal ganglia function and potentially mediate its therapeutic effects in parkinsonism.",valid
36266006,"Adenosine-sensitive re-entrant atrial tachycardia (AT) originating from near the atrioventricular (AV) node or AV annulus resembles other supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs), and the differential diagnosis is sometimes challenging. This study sought to develop a novel technique to distinguish adenosine-sensitive re-entrant AT from AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia (ORT). The study retrospectively studied 117 re-entrant SVTs that were successfully entrained by atrial overdrive pacing (AOP) (27 adenosine-sensitive re-entrant ATs, 63 AVNRTs, 27 ORTs). If the second atrial electrogram after AOP (A2) at the earliest atrial activation site (EAAS) accelerated to the pacing cycle length, the EAAS was considered orthodromically activated. Then, we compared the sequence of A2 and the last entrained His bundle (H∗) and QRS complex (V∗). The study hypothesized that the last entrained impulse would activate the EAAS before it enters the AV node, His bundle, and ventricle during AT (A2-H∗-V∗) but would activate the EAAS after the His bundle activation during AVNRT and ORT (H∗-V∗-A2 or H∗-A2-V∗). Orthodromic EAAS activation was documented during AOP in 84 SVTs (72%) when performing AOP from sites proximal to the entrance of SVTs. A2-H∗-V∗ responses were observed in 21 of 25 ATs, but were never for AVNRTs or ORTs. All ORTs and fast-slow AVNRTs had H∗-V∗-A2 responses. Eleven of 21 slow-fast AVNRTs had H∗-A2-V∗ responses. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the A2-H∗-V∗ response for diagnosing AT were 84%, 100%, 100%, and 94%, respectively. The last entrainment sequence was useful for differentiating ATs with diagnostic difficulties.",valid
33127932,"The semipermeable capillary walls not only enable the removal of excess body water and solutes during hemodialysis (HD) but also provide an essential mechanism for maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis. Here, we investigated transcapillary transport processes on the whole-body level using the three-pore model of the capillary endothelium with large, small and ultrasmall pores. The transcapillary transport and cardiovascular response to a 4-h hemodialysis (HD) with 2 L ultrafiltration were analyzed by simulations in a virtual patient using the three-pore model of the capillary wall integrated in the whole-body compartmental model of the cardiovascular system with baroreflex mechanisms. The three-pore model revealed substantial changes during HD in the magnitude and direction of transcapillary water flows through small and ultrasmall pores and associated changes in the transcapillary convective transport of proteins and small solutes. The fraction of total capillary hydraulic conductivity attributed to ultrasmall pores was found to play an important role in the transcapillary water transport during HD thus influencing the cardiovascular response to HD. The presented model provides a novel computational framework for a detailed analysis of microvascular exchange during HD and as such may contribute to a better understanding of dialysis-induced changes in blood volume and blood pressure.",valid

6734777,"In cocultures of skeletal muscle and sympathetic ganglia from chick embryos, synaptic boutons on skeletal muscle cells and varicosities in the neuritic bundles were observed electron microscopically. Synaptic endings on skeletal muscles were bulbous. Most synaptic boutons simply made contact with muscle fibers, but some boutons appeared as concave invaginations into the sarcolemma. In the neuritic bundles, numerous varicosities were observed. Close approximations were found between the synaptic boutons and skeletal muscles and between the varicosities and neurites (dendrites or axons), but no membrane thickening nor subsynaptic infolding was observed in either synapse; in our cultures the contacts were characteristic of the autonomic nervous system. In both synapses, three variations were demonstrated by KMnO4 fixation after 5-hydroxydopamine incubation: (i) containing predominantly small dense-core vesicles (noradrenergic type), (ii) predominantly small clear vesicles (cholinergic types), and (iii) a mixture of both small dense-core and small clear vesicles (mixed type). Cytochemically, the varicosities in the neuritic bundles were predominantly noradrenergic at 1 week in culture, and both the synaptic boutons on skeletal muscles and the varicosities in the neuritic bundles contained a mixed population of small dense-core and small clear vesicles at intermediate times, with a gradual shift to cholinergic characteristics. These findings strongly suggest that in this culture system some sympathetic neurons or fibers become cholinergic (neuronal plasticity).",valid
5808822,"In vivo incorporation of choline-methyl-(14)C into liver lecithin and its biosynthetic precursors was studied in CCl(4)-treated rats. Radioactivity in cytidine diphosphoryl (CDP-)choline and lecithin was reduced to one-third of control levels, whereas that of phosphorylcholine was increased to 4.7 times control levels. Incorporation of phosphorylcholine-(32)P into lecithin by homogenates prepared from livers of CCl(4)-treated animals was reduced, but conversion of CDP-choline-(32)P to lecithin by the isolated microsomal fraction did not show any significant depression. A block in the synthesis of CDP-choline is indicated. The in vivo utilization of methionine for lecithin synthesis was not affected. After intravenous injection of palmitic acid-1-(14)C, radioactivity of triglycerides from microsomal and mitochondrial fractions was markedly lower than the controls, whereas radioactivity of triglycerides in the soluble fraction was greatly increased. Radioactivity of diglycerides changed from 0.5% of total lipids in the control to 10% of total lipids in CCl(4)-treated animals. Incorporation of palmitic acid into phospholipids was also suppressed. The results demonstrate that synthesis of both phospholipids and triglycerides is inhibited in rats 4-5 hr after CCl(4) administration.",valid

Vimentin (VIM) and E-cadherin (E-cad) are molecular markers that play important roles in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which has been shown to be correlated with tumor progression. Herein, we investigated the associations between clinicopathological parameters and VIM/E-cad expression in primary T1 stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Real-time PCR was performed on RNA extracted from tumor tissue isolated from 54 patients with T1 stage NSCLC. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure the protein levels of VIM and E-cad. The paired-samples t-test, independent-samples t- test, Kappa test, and nonparametric test were used to perform statistical analyses. The expression of VIM were lower (P<0.001) and that of E-cad was higher (P<0.001) in tumor tissue when compared with the normal tissue at the transcriptional level. The RNA of VIM in adenocarcinomas was significantly higher than that found in squamous cell carcinomas (P<0.01). Moreover, the level of metastasis observed in the lymph node was significantly higher than that observed in metastasis outside of the lymph node (P<0.05). Vimentin protein had a lower profile in the tumor tissue, and the protein level of E-cad was higher in the tumor tissue. The IHC score of VIM in tumor tissue was found associated with both the pathological type and smoke index, and the score of E-cad was found to be related to visceral pleura involvement. In conclusions, VIM is downregulated and E-cad is upregulated in T1 stage NSCLC. Our study results suggest that a mesenchymal-epithelial transition may take place in the early-stage of tumor development, and that EMT occurs when the tumor develops into a certain stage.",valid
9429982,"Click evoked otoacoustic emissions (CEOAEs) are an objective and reliable method of assessing cochlear status, particularly suitable for newborns. This study aimed to assess CEOAE inter-aural and gender differences. Other non-auditory factors, such as infant's head size and weight, were considered. Band averaged CEOAEs were analyzed for 120 healthy, full term newborns, 61 females and 59 males. The babies were randomly selected from the nursery and tested in a quiet room away from the ward, using an Otodynamic ILO 92 system. The CEOAEs of the females were significantly larger than those of the males. For the frequency bands 2, 3, and 4 kHz and for the overall response, the emissions were larger in the right ear, for both males and females. These inter-aural differences were more pronounced in male subjects than in female subjects. These findings may reflect the accumulating evidence that differences exist in efferent cochlear inhibition.",valid

Recent advances led to the creation of an automated FEC system that performs with increased precision and reduces the need for training of analysts. However, the variability contributed by analysts has not been quantified for FEC methods, nor has the impact of training on analyst performance been quantified. In this study, three untrained analysts performed FECs on the same slides using the modified McMaster (MM), modified Wisconsin (MW), and the automated system with two different algorithms: particle shape analysis (PSA) and machine learning (ML). Samples were screened and separated into negative (no strongylid eggs seen), 1-200 eggs per gram of feces (EPG), 201-500 EPG, 501-1000 EPG, and 1001+ EPG levels, and ten repeated counts were performed for each level and method. Analysts were then formally trained and repeated the study protocol. Between analyst variability (BV), analyst precision (AP), and the proportion of variance contributed by analysts were calculated. Total BV was significantly lower for MM post-training (p = 0.0105). Additionally, AP variability and analyst variance both tended to decrease for the manual MM and MW methods. Overall, MM had the lowest BV both pre- and post-training, although PSA and ML were minimally affected by analyst training. This research illustrates not only how the automated methods could be useful when formal training is unavailable but also how impactful formal training is for traditional manual FEC methods.",valid

Overall, orthopaedic conditions vary widely in France regarding the patients involved and treatments applied. For PFFs specifically, data are limited. Moreover, the ongoing expansion of geriatric orthopaedics holds promise for improving overall postoperative survival. The objectives of this retrospective study of a nationwide French database were: 1) to describe the pathway of patients with PFFs regarding access to care, healthcare institutions involved, and times to management; 2) to look for associations linking these parameters to post-operative mortality. Across France, variations exist in healthcare service availability and time to management for patients with PFFs. A retrospective analysis of data in a de-identified representative sample of statutory-health-insurance beneficiaries in France (Échantillon généraliste des bénéficiaires, EGB, containing data for 1/97 beneficiaries) was conducted. All patients older than 60 years of age who were managed for PFFs between 2005 and 2017 were included. The following data were collected for each patient: age, management method, Charlson's Comorbidity Index (CCI), home-to-hospital distance by road, and type of hospital (public, non-profit private, or for-profit private), and time to surgery were collected. The study outcomes were the incidence of PFF, mortality during the first postoperative year, changes in mortality between 2005 and 2017, and prognostic factors. In total 8026 fractures were included.

Immunogen-specific VRC01-like B cells were isolated at different time points after immunization, their VH and VL genes were sequenced, and the corresponding antibodies characterized. VRC01 B cell sub-populations with distinct cross-reactivity properties were activated by each immunogen, and these differences correlated with distinct biophysical and biochemical features of the germline-targeting immunogens.

Soc. 2004, 126, 2692] has been examined here through DFT calculations at the MPW1K(DCM)/6-31+G** level. Formation of these seven-membered carbocycles is a domino process that comprises three consecutive reactions. The first one is a polar Diels-Alder reaction that is initialized by the nucleophilic attack of Cp to the beta-conjugated position of acrolein, yielding the formation of the endo and exo [4 + 2] cycloadducts. The corresponding LA-[4 + 2] cycloadduct complexes equilibrate through a skeleton rearrangement with a low free activation energy with two seven-membered zwitterionic intermediates, which undergo a rapid intramolecular hydride shift to yield irreversibly the formally endo and exo [4 + 3] cycloadducts.

Comparison was made between the trigger systems of the trigger delay, inflation volume delivered, and proportion of spontaneous respiratory efforts detected. The airway pressure trigger gave a superior performance: at the two lower inflation times the trigger delay was shorter and inflation volume delivered greater.

17589384,"One of the clinical characteristics associated with septic shock is heart failure. Several lines of evidence indicate that functional consequences of heart failure in septic shock are linked to the activated NO-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) pathway. We have previously shown that the high-affinity cGMP export transporter, multidrug resistance protein 5 (MRP5), is expressed in the heart, which modulates intracellular concentrations and, hence, the effects of cGMP. Thus, modified expression of cardiac MRP5 in septic shock can alter cGMP concentrations and contribute to the development of heart failure. We therefore investigated MRP5 expression in the heart using two established murine models of septic shock (intraperitoneal LPS injection and surgical implantation of a stent into the ascending colon, resulting in a multibacterial peritonitis [CASP, colon ascendens stent peritonitis] in C57BL/6N mice, respectively; n = 38). Cardiac MRP5 was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence. The protein was localized in the endothelial wall, smooth muscle, and cardiac myocytes. MRP5 mRNA expression was significantly reduced compared with controls both in the LPS (31.9 +/- 16.8 x 10(-4) vs. 54.1 +/- 14.8 x 10(-4), P = 0.025) and CASP model (18.3 +/- 9.4 x 10(-4) vs. 42.8 +/- 12.1 x 10(-4), P = 0.009; MRP5/glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase copy numbers, respectively). In parallel, IL-6 plasma levels were significantly increased in both models. Incubation of cultured murine cardiomyocytes (HL1) with 5 ng/mL IL-6 resulted in decreased expression of MRP5 (54% of control), as did incubation of the cells with serum from septic mice (LPS serum, 22% of control; CASP serum, 11% of control). In conclusion, cardiac expression of the cGMP export transporter MRP5 is decreased in two murine models of septic shock, most likely by a transcriptional mechanism. Reduced cGMP export as a consequence of decreased MRP5 expression can attenuate heart failure in sepsis.",valid

We show that the realizations of this auxiliary process can be obtained after applying a conditional measurement scheme to the original ones, providing is this way an alternative measurement interpretation of the thermodynamic approach. General results are obtained for renewal counting processes, that is, those where the time intervals between consecutive events are independent and defined by a unique waiting time distribution. The underlying statistical mechanics is controlled by the same waiting time distribution, rescaled by an exponential decay measured by the free energy function. A scale invariance, shift closure, and intermittence phenomena are obtained and interpreted in this context. Similar conclusions apply for nonrenewal processes when the memory between successive events is induced by a stochastic waiting time distribution.",valid

The objective of our study was to compare the metabolic profiles for allotransplant recipients and thereby identify metabolic characteristics of patients with treatment-requiring cGVHD. The study included 51 consecutive patients (29 men and 22 women; median age: 44 years, range: 15-66 years) transplanted with peripheral blood stem cells derived from human leukocyte antigen-matched family donors. All serum samples investigated by global metabolomic profiling were collected approximately 1 year posttransplant (median 358 days). Thirty-one of the 51 patients (61%) had cGVHD 1 year posttransplant. The affected organs were (number of patients) liver/bile duct (23), eyes (15), gastrointestinal tract (14), skin (13), mouth (10), lungs (3), and urogenital tract (1). We compared the metabolic profile for patients with and without cGVHD, and a Random Forrest Classification Analysis then resulted in 75% accuracy in differentiating the two groups. The 30 top-ranked metabolites from this comparison included increased levels of bile acids, several metabolites from the cytokine-responsive kynurenine pathway for tryptophan degradation, pro-inflammatory lipid metabolites, phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolites derived from the gut microbial flora, and metabolites reflecting increased oxidative stress. However, nine of these 30 top-ranked metabolites were probably altered due to cyclosporine or steroid treatment, and we therefore did a hierarchical clustering analysis including all 51 patients but only based on the other 21 cGVHD-specific metabolites. This analysis identified three patient subsets: one cluster included mainly patients without cGVHD and had generally low metabolite levels; another cluster included mainly patients with cGVHD (most patients with at least three affected organs) and high metabolite levels, and the last intermediate group including cGVHD patients with limited organ involvement. We conclude that allotransplant recipients with cGVHD have an altered metabolic profile caused both by the disease and its immunosuppressive treatment.",valid

Whereas platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling is critical for this process during embryonic development, its role from the postnatal stages through adulthood remains unclear. We investigated the potential role of PDGF signaling during microvessel assembly by measuring in vivo the migration of labeled fibroblasts to PDGF in mesenteric connective tissue and by examining PDGF-B and PDGF receptor-beta (PGDFR-beta) expression in microvascular networks during normal maturation. PDGF-B homodimer (PDGF-BB; 30 ng/ml) application elicited a significant (P < 0.05) increase (7.8 +/- 4.1 cells) in labeled fibroblasts within 100 microm of the source micropipette after 2 h. PDGF-A homodimer (30 ng/ml) application and control solution did not elicit directed migration. PDGF-B was expressed in microvessel endothelium and smooth muscle, whereas PDGFR-beta was expressed in endothelium, smooth muscle, and interstitial fibroblasts. Given that PDGF-BB elicits fibroblast migration in the mesentery and that PDGF-B and PDGFR-beta are expressed in a pattern that indicates paracrine signaling from microvessels to the interstitium, the results are consistent with a role for PDGF-B in perivascular cell recruitment to microvessels.",valid

Furthermore, characterization of differences in localizable VF loss patterns between algorithms, rather than global summary measures, can be important for clinician interpretation when transitioning testing strategies. In this study, we determined the effect of transitioning from SITA Standard to SITA Faster on VF loss patterns in glaucomatous eyes undergoing longitudinal VF testing in a real-world clinical setting. Archetypal analysis was used to derive composition weights of 16 clinically relevant VF patterns (i.e., archetypes (AT)) from patient VFs. We found switching from SITA Standard to SITA Faster was associated with less preservation of VF loss (i.e., abnormal AT 2-4, 6-9, 11, 13, 14) relative to successive SITA Standard exams (P value < 0.01) and was associated with relatively greater preservation of AT 1, the normal VF (P value < 0.01). Eyes that transition from SITA Standard to SITA Faster in a real-world clinical setting have an increased likelihood of preserving patterns reflecting a normal VF and lower tendency to preserve patterns reflecting abnormal VF as compared to consecutive SITA Standard exams in the same eye.",valid

Two questionnaires were used: one with few questions which was answered by all 68 departments, and a more comprehensive questionnaire which was answered by 51 departments. The study shows that thrombolytic therapy now is use in all departments as opposed to 25% two years ago. In connection with introduction of thrombolytic therapy scientific studies are performed in 75% of the departments.

For functional identification the cDNA was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and formation of calendic acid was analyzed by RP-HPLC.

1582238,"In this open study, 41 hypertensive patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus were treated with the combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocker amosulalol hydrochloride for 24 weeks, either alone or added to existing antihypertensive therapy. The effects on blood pressure, glucose and lipid metabolism were examined. Daily administration of 20 to 60 mg amosulalol caused a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure within 2 weeks. This effect was stable, lasting for the entire trial period. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased from 174 +/- 13/92 +/- 9 mmHg at the beginning to 148 +/- 16/80 +/- 11 mmHg at the end of the trial. Heart rate was not affected. Plasma glucose and haemoglobin Alc levels showed a tendency to decrease without any statistical significance. Total and HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels also remained unchanged. Although 3 patients had complained of dizziness, all were easily manageable. The results indicate that amosulalol is effective in the treatment of hypertension in non-insulin dependent diabetics and does not affect glucose and lipid metabolism.",valid

The response rates for 102 patients in chronic phase were: complete hematologic, 94.1%; complete cytogenetic, 69.6%; and complete molecular response, 54.9%. For 14 patients in the accelerated phase, the respective response rates were 85.7, 35.7 and 28.6%. The 3-year progression-free survival and 5-year overall survival were 73.3 and 74.8%. Although skin hypopigmentation occurs as the most common side effect (77.6%), imatinib is still well tolerated. In addition to the known pretreatment characteristics of spleen size, leukocyte and platelet counts, disease phase and Sokal scores, we found that delayed therapy, variant Philadelphia chromosome translocations and IM-related grade 3/4 leucopenia were associated with an inferior cytogenetic response. Four factors emerged as predictors of disease progression: molecular response, cytogenetic response, disease phase and disease duration prior to imatinib treatment, but only the latter three remained significant after multivariate analysis. The results indicate that the suboptimal outcome in Chinese patients is associated with delayed imatinib therapy, so the importance of the optimal treatment opportunity for CML should be emphasized.",valid
20955179,"Since decades, plant male sterility is considered a powerful tool for biological containment to minimize unwanted self-pollination for hybrid seed production. Furthermore, prevention of pollen dispersal also answers to concerns regarding transgene flow via pollen from Genetically Modified (GM) crops to traditional crop fields or wild relatives. We induced male sterility by suppressing endogenous general transcription factor genes, TAFs, using anther-specific promoters combined with artificial microRNA (amiRNA) technology (Schwab et al., 2006). The system was made reversible by the ethanol inducible expression of an amiRNA-insensitive form of the target gene. We provide proof of concept in eggplant, a cultivated crop belonging to the Solanaceae family that includes many important food crops. The transgenic eggplants that we generated are completely male sterile and fertility can be fully restored by short treatments with ethanol, confirming the efficiency but also the reliability of the system in view of open field cultivation. By combining this system with induced parthenocarpy (Rotino et al., 1997), we provide a novel example of complete transgene containment in eggplant, which enables biological mitigation measures for the benefit of coexistence or biosafety purposes for GM crop cultivation.",valid

26844618,"Follicular unit transplantation is the most commonly performed technique in modern restorative hair transplantation surgery. It relies on the acquisition of intact follicular units from microdissected scalp skin strips and their subsequent transplantation into the recipient regions affected by alopecia. Ideally, the translocation of follicular units from the balding-resistant areas of the scalp (usually the occipital region) to the recipient site should not result in any morphological change in the grafts. Nevertheless, the insults associated with surgical intervention present grafted follicles to mechanical and chemical cues differently from those of the physiological steady-state conditions in undamaged skin. This disruption of the normal follicular microenvironment might alter important aspects of hair biology in grafts, for example, hair cycle and pigmentation, and, in turn, could lead to differences in hair appearance, eventually culminating in a diminished esthetical outcome of the surgery. In this study, the authors analyzed native and grafted scalp hair follicles (HFs) from 2 patients who had undergone follicular unit transplantation surgeries formerly. Scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy-based histomorphometry revealed a marked enlargement of follicular structures in the grafts with a concomitant increase in hair shaft diameter. Immunohistological staining confirmed a thickening of the dermal sheath in transplanted HFs that also harbored a denser vascular network. Taken together, these results show that the grafted HFs analyzed were subjected to marked morphological changes during their residence in the recipient site and that this phenomenon is associated with a modulation of follicular vascularization.",valid

The aim of this study was therefore to assess the prevalence, awareness, management and control of hypertension among a young adult population in their reproductive ages living in urban poor communities in Accra. Cross-sectional, population-based survey of 714 young adults in their reproductive ages (women aged 15-49 years, men aged 15-59 years) living in three urban poor suburbs of Accra, Ghana. The overall prevalence of hypertension in all three communities was 28.3% (women 25.6% and men 31.0%). Among respondents who had hypertension, 7.4% were aware of their condition; 4% were on antihypertensive medication while only 3.5% of hypertensive individuals had adequate blood pressure (BP) control (BP <140/90  mmHg). The level of awareness and treatment was lower in men than in women (3.1 and 1.3% for men and 11.9 and 6.5% for women, respectively). Among individuals with hypertension, the rate of control was higher among women than among men (5.0 and 2.1%, respectively). Although about a quarter of the young adult population in these low-income communities of Accra have hypertension, the levels of awareness, treatment and control are abysmally low.

Data on WWE delivering between 1st January 2012 and 31st December 2014 were collected. Demographic (age, parity, Trust residence) and socio-economic (employment status, deprivation level) factors were compared between three groups: (1) women delivering at the regional unit from its catchment, (2) women delivering at the regional unit from outside its catchment and (3) women delivering at peripheral units. 447 WWE delivered in the 3-year period. 48% (214/447) and 52% (233/447) delivered at regional and peripheral units respectively. 42% delivering at the regional unit were from its catchment and 58% outside. There was no difference in parity, employment status or deprivation of WWE from outside the regional unit catchment who accessed joint services and those who did not. Trust residence was the strongest predictor of delivery location with women from adjacent Trusts over 90% less likely to deliver at peripheral units. Maternal age was also a predictor of delivery location with a woman aged 30 being 50% less likely to deliver at a peripheral unit than one aged 20. 52% of all WWE and 63% outside the regional unit catchment do not access the joint service.

19900279,"Worldwide, coral reefs are in decline due to a range of anthropogenic disturbances, and are now also under threat from global climate change. Virtually nothing is currently known about the genetic factors that might determine whether corals adapt to the changing climate or continue to decline. Quantitative genetics studies aiming to identify the adaptively important genomic loci will require a high-resolution genetic linkage map. The phylogenetic position of corals also suggests important applications for a coral genetic map in studies of ancestral metazoan genome architecture. We constructed a high-resolution genetic linkage map for the reef-building coral Acropora millepora, the first genetic map reported for any coral, or any non-Bilaterian animal. More than 500 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were developed, most of which are transferable in populations from Orpheus Island and Great Keppel Island. The map contains 429 markers (393 gene-based SNPs and 36 microsatellites) distributed in 14 linkage groups, and spans 1,493 cM with an average marker interval of 3.4 cM. Sex differences in recombination were observed in a few linkage groups, which may be caused by haploid selection. Comparison of the coral map with other metazoan genomes (human, nematode, fly, anemone and placozoan) revealed synteny regions. Our study develops a framework that will be essential for future studies of adaptation in coral and it also provides an important resource for future genome sequence assembly and for comparative genomics studies on the evolution of metazoan genome structure.",valid
16638914,"To report a case of propofol-induced priapism. A 17-year-old male receiving propofol for induction of anesthesia during a cardiac ablation procedure developed priapism that required medical intervention and discontinuation of propofol. The priapism developed after a total propofol dose of 550 mg, lasted for 2 hours, and resolved immediately following medical intervention. The following day, the patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram and received a total propofol dose of 40 mg throughout the procedure. He again developed priapism, which resolved within one hour without medical intervention. Priapism experienced by this patient is considered to be drug-induced because of the temporal relationship, recurrence with rechallenge, and dose-response relationship. Using the Naranjo probability scale, we determined that propofol was a highly probable causative agent of priapism in this patient. Although, as of April 4, 2006, this adverse effect has not been previously reported, there is a strong correlation of propofol to priapism in this patient. Clinicians should be aware of this adverse effect.",valid
1843517,"Aortic input impedance and hydraulic power were measured in patients with ventricular septal defect (VSD). Aortic input impedance consists of the characteristic impedance (index of aortic distensibility) and the terminal impedance (index of peripheral resistance) which represent the left ventricular hydraulic load. The external left ventricular hydraulic power consists of steady power which transmits blood to the peripheral vasculature and pulsatile power which is converted into heat energy. The ratio of pulsatile to total power indicates the efficiency of the arterial system. The present study was carried out on 6 patients with VSD whose Qp/Qs was greater than 2.0 (VSD group) and 10 age-matched controls who had a history of Kawasaki disease without coronary complications at the time of cardiac catheterization (control group). Descending aortic pressure and flow velocity were measured simultaneously at the level of the 10th thoracic vertebra using a multisensor-catheter. Impedance data were calculated from Fourier analysis of these findings. Characteristic impedance did not differ between the 2 groups. Terminal impedance was higher in the VSD group with the increasing peripheral resistance and vascular afterload. The pulsatile component of external hydraulic power was similar in both groups, however, the steady component was lower in the VSD group indicating a higher ratio of pulsatile to total power in the VSD group. In conclusion, vascular afterload was increased and the efficiency of the arterial system was reduced in patients with VSD having large shunts.",valid

However, in this paper we will show that the SSP had many precursors and that the road to such an instrument was long and winding. Our analysis of hitherto little-known studies on children in strange situations allowed us to compare these earlier attempts with the SSP. We argue that it was the combination of Ainsworth's working experience with William Blatz and John Bowlby, her own research in Uganda and Baltimore, and the strong connection of the SSP with attachment theory, that made the SSP differ enough from the other strange situation studies to become one of the most widely used instruments in developmental psychology today.",valid

11027283,"Chloroplast translation is mediated by nucleus-encoded factors that interact with distinct cis-acting RNA elements. A U-rich sequence within the 5' untranslated region of the psbD mRNA has previously been shown to be required for its translation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. By using UV cross-linking assays, we have identified a 40-kDa RNA binding protein, which binds to the wild-type psbD leader, but is unable to recognize a nonfunctional leader mutant lacking the U-rich motif. RNA binding is restored in a chloroplast cis-acting suppressor. The functions of several site-directed psbD leader mutants were analyzed with transgenic C. reinhardtii chloroplasts and the in vitro RNA binding assay. A clear correlation between photosynthetic activity and the capability to bind RNA by the 40-kDa protein was observed. Furthermore, the data obtained suggest that the poly(U) region serves as a molecular spacer between two previously characterized cis-acting elements, which are involved in RNA stabilization and translation. RNA-protein complex formation depends on the nuclear Nac2 gene product that is part of a protein complex required for the stabilization of the psbD mRNA. The sedimentation properties of the 40-kDa RNA binding protein suggest that it interacts directly with this Nac2 complex and, as a result, links processes of chloroplast RNA metabolism and translation.",valid
12110526,"Mammalian preimplantation embryos experience a critical switch from an oxidative to a predominantly glycolytic metabolism. In this study, the change in nutrient metabolism between the 2-cell and blastocyst stages was followed by measuring single embryo concentrations of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glycolytic metabolites with microfluorometric enzymatic cycling assays. When the normal values were established, further changes that occur as a result of the induction of apoptosis by exposure to high-glucose conditions were examined. From the 2-cell to the blastocyst stage, the embryos experienced an increase in TCA metabolites and a dramatic increase in fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). The high TCA metabolites may result from accumulation of substrate due to a slowing of TCA cycle metabolism as glycolysis predominates. Embryos exposed to elevated glucose conditions experienced significantly lower FBP, suggesting decreased glycolysis, significantly higher pyruvate, suggesting increased pyruvate uptake by the embryos in response to decreased glycolysis, and increased TCA metabolites, suggesting an inability to oxidize the pyruvate and a slowing of the TCA cycle. We speculate that the glycolytic changes lead to dysfunction of the outer mitochondrial membrane that results in the abnormal TCA metabolite pattern and triggers the apoptotic event.",valid

Computerized tomography allows differentiation of fluid filled from solid masses and vascular tumors. 2.

For modal completion (aka subjective contours), Kanizsa figures were constructed using black 'pac-men' to form regular polygons on colored paper. For amodal completion, portions of variously colored regular 2D polygons were occluded by black circles or other black figures. For each task, Griffin provided a vocal English shape label for five possible shapes designated by their vertices (one, two, three, four, six). His accuracy was high for both amodal completed figures, including probe stimuli (28/38 correct) and modally completed figures (29/38 correct), with chance=0.20. The modally completed case (i.e., Kanizsa subjective figures) is of particular importance as there are no shared image parts between training and testing stimuli. We draw several conclusions from these results. First, a surface level completion process is fully operative insofar as Griffin was able to correctly identify shapes that differed considerably from training images. Second, because parrots can generalize from shapes of real objects to drawings where original image contours were clearly absent, the data provide a compelling example of shape invariance, indicating that visual shapes are processed far beyond that of their image description. Third, parrots with a repertoire of multiple vocal responses can be rigorously tested for visual competencies, an option as yet to be tried in other experimental animals.",valid

17299248,"A circadian clock controls various physiological and behavioral rhythms. In mammals, a master circadian clock exists in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, and slave oscillators can be found in most tissues. These circadian oscillations are controlled by ""clock genes"". The negative feedback loop is thought to function as a molecular mechanism of the circadian clock. It is plausible that clock genes may control lipid metabolism through so-called clock-controlled genes and that lipid metabolism-related clock-controlled genes may play important roles in the circadian change of lipid metabolism. Recently research has focused on the relationships between the clock system and lipid metabolism. In this review, we discuss the following items: 1) circadian clock system, 2) effect of the diet on clock gene expression, 3) effect of clock mutation on lipid metabolism, and 4) effect of streptozotocin-induced diabetes and ob mutation on clock gene expression and lipid metabolism. In this review we have summarized how the circadian clock affects lipid metabolism through the expression of lipid metabolism-related clock-controlled genes and at the same time discussed how abnormal metabolism of lipid affects the expression of clock genes. Further experiments are needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism of interaction between clock genes and lipid metabolisms.",valid
15053625,"Previously, we have shown that the ferryl ion ([FeIVO]2+) is easily produced from Fenton's reagent (i.e., a mixture of Fe2+ ions and H2O2 in aqueous solution), using DFT and Car-Parrinello MD calculations. To verify that the ferryl ion can indeed act as the active species in oxidation reactions with Fenton's reagent, we study in the present paper the reactivity of the ferryl ion toward an organic substrate, in particular the oxidation of methane to methanol. In the first part of this paper, we perform static DFT calculations on the reaction of CH4 with the [(H2O)5FeIVO]2+ complex in vacuo that show a strong prevalence of the oxygen-rebound mechanism over the methane coordination mechanism. This is in agreement with the static DFT results for methane oxidation by biocatalysts MMO and P450, but not with those for methane oxidation by bare metal-oxo ions, where the methane coordination mechanism prevails. The highest energy barrier in the oxygen-rebound mechanism is only 3 kcal/mol in vacuo, whereas in the methane coordination mechanism the highest barrier is 23 kcal/mol. Overall the oxidation reaction energy is downhill by 47 kcal/mol. We conclude that the ferryl ion can indeed act as the oxidative intermediate in the Fenton oxidation of organic species. In the second part of this paper, we perform a preliminary assessment of solvent effects on the oxidation by the ferryl ion in aqueous solution using the method of constrained (first principles) molecular dynamics. The free energy barrier of the H-abstraction reaction from methane by the ferryl ion (i.e., the first step in the rebound mechanism) in aqueous solution is, with 22 kcal/mol in solution, significantly higher than in vacuo. Given the fact that methane has a relatively strong C-H bond (ca. 10 kcal/mol stronger than the C-H bonds in the more typical Fenton's reagent substrates), we infer that for many organic substrates oxidation with the ferryl ion as an active intermediate may be a perfectly viable route.",valid

In this post hoc, exploratory analysis, we investigated the association between plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and activities of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) and healthy controls. We measured plasma levels of BDNF and activities of GPx and SOD in individuals with BD (n=59) and healthy controls (n=26). Information related to current and past psychiatric/medical history, as well as to metabolic comorbidities, was also reported. There were negative correlations between BDNF, GPx (r=-.449, P≤.001) and GPx/SOD ratio (r=-.503, P<.001), and a positive correlation between BDNF and SOD (r=.254, P=.020). There was a moderating effect of body mass index (BMI) on the association between BDNF and GPx/SOD rate ratio [(RR)=1.002, P=.034]; interactions between impaired glucose metabolism (IGM), GPx (RR=1.016, P=.033), and GPx/SOD ratio (RR=1.026, P=.002) were also observed. These results were significant in models that included age, gender, alcohol, tobacco and medication use.

During in-vivo swine studies (n = 6), 12-lead ECG signals were recorded at baseline and following coronary artery occlusion. Ischemic indices calculated from each lead showed statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase within 2 min of occlusion compared to baseline. Following myocardial infarction, spontaneous ventricular tachycardia episodes (n = 3) were preceded by significant (p < 0.05) increase of the ischemic index ~1-4 min prior to the onset of the tachy-arrhythmias. In order to assess the respiratory status during apnea, the mechanical ventilator was paused for up to 2 min during normal breathing. We observed that the RR and TV estimation algorithms detected apnea within 7.9 ± 1.1 sec and 5.5 ± 2.2 sec, respectively, while the estimated RR and TV values were 0 breaths/min and less than 100 ml, respectively.

22083019,"To date, the lack of a suitable human cardiac cell source has been the major setback in regenerating the human myocardium, either by cell-based transplantation or by cardiac tissue engineering. Cardiomyocytes become terminally-differentiated soon after birth and lose their ability to proliferate. There is no evidence that stem/progenitor cells derived from other sources, such as the bone marrow or the cord blood, are able to give rise to the contractile heart muscle cells following transplantation into the heart. The need to regenerate or repair the damaged heart muscle has not been met by adult stem cell therapy, either endogenous or via cell delivery. The genetically stable human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have unlimited expansion ability and unrestricted plasticity, proffering a pluripotent reservoir for in vitro derivation of large supplies of human somatic cells that are restricted to the lineage in need of repair and regeneration. Due to the prevalence of cardiovascular disease worldwide and acute shortage of donor organs, there is intense interest in developing hESC-based therapies as an alternative approach. However, how to channel the wide differentiation potential of pluripotent hESCs efficiently and predictably to a desired phenotype has been a major challenge for both developmental study and clinical translation. Conventional approaches rely on multi-lineage inclination of pluripotent cells through spontaneous germ layer differentiation, resulting in inefficient and uncontrollable lineage-commitment that is often followed by phenotypic heterogeneity and instability, hence, a high risk of tumorigenicity (see a schematic in Fig. 1A). In addition, undefined foreign/animal biological supplements and/or feeders that have typically been used for the isolation, expansion, and differentiation of hESCs may make direct use of such cell-specialized grafts in patients problematic. To overcome these obstacles, we have resolved the elements of a defined culture system necessary and sufficient for sustaining the epiblast pluripotence of hESCs, serving as a platform for de novo derivation of clinically-suitable hESCs and effectively directing such hESCs uniformly towards clinically-relevant lineages by small molecules (see a schematic in Fig. 1B). After screening a variety of small molecules and growth factors, we found that such defined conditions rendered nicotinamide (NAM) sufficient to induce the specification of cardiomesoderm direct from pluripotent hESCs that further progressed to cardioblasts that generated human beating cardiomyocytes with high efficiency (Fig. 2). We defined conditions for induction of cardioblasts direct from pluripotent hESCs without an intervening multi-lineage embryoid body stage, enabling well-controlled efficient derivation of a large supply of human cardiac cells across the spectrum of developmental stages for cell-based therapeutics.",valid
22643005,"The spermatozoon is one of the most differentiated cells in mammals and its production requires an extremely complex machinery. Subtle but critical molecular changes take place during capacitation, which comprises the last series of maturation steps that naturally occur between the cauda epididymidis where spermatozoa are stored and their ultimate destination inside the oocyte. Phospholipases, by hydrolyzing various phospholipids, have been found to be critical in sperm processes such as 1) the control of flagellum beats, 2) capacitation - the molecular transformations preparing the sperm for fertilization, 3) acrosome reaction and 4) oocyte activation by eliciting calcium oscillations. The emerging important role of phospholipases is also emphasized by the fact that alterations of sperm lipids can lead to infertility. Phospholipases may represent valuable targets to develop anti- and pro-fertility drugs. Results obtained in mice are encouraging, since treatment of sperm with recombinant sPLA(2) of group X, known to be involved in capacitation, improves fertilization in vitro, while co-injection of PLCζ RNA with infertile sperm restores oocyte activation.",valid

A territory-wide, biopsy-proven, Chinese cohort. Masked review of orbital images, medical records, and histopathology reports. A total of 115 (94%) of the 122 patients in our cohort had preoperative orbital images (computed tomography=105, magnetic resonance imaging=40). Among them, 103/115 (90%) showed enlarged lacrimal glands, and 91 (88%) were bilateral. Nerve enlargement was observed: infraorbital in 31/115 (27%) patients and frontal in 17/115 (15%), 10 and 9 being bilateral, respectively. At least 1 or more extraocular muscle (EOM) enlargement was found in 41/115 (37%) patients, bilaterally in 20. Lateral rectus occurred in 30 (73%) of these 41 EOM patients and inferior rectus in 28 (68%). Two adjacent EOMs (inferior and lateral recti in 11 patients, inferior and medial recti in 7 patients) or multiple EOMs (at least 3) were enlarged in 23/41 (56%) and 13/41 (32%) of the patients, respectively. Intraconal lesions (67% vs 11%, P<0.05), infraorbital (83% vs 23%, P<0.005), or frontal (50% vs 15%, P<0.05) nerve enlargement was significantly associated with IgG4-RON (6 patients) by univariate analyses. Asymmetric lacrimal gland enlargement and discrete orbital mass (both P<0.05) were associated with IgG4-ROL (9 patients) by multivariate analyses. In this IgG4-ROD cohort, most patients had bilateral enlarged lacrimal glands, and the lateral rectus is the most frequently involved EOM. For the first time, unique radiological patterns associated with the development of IgG4-RON and IgG4-ROL are found.",valid

The XQD-BS-ES rat model was established by adriamycin plus propylthiouracil method. Survived modeled rats were then randomly divided to 5 groups i.e., the model group (n = 11, administered with normal saline by gastrogavage), the Western medicine (WM) group (n =11 , administered with perindopril and hydrochlorothiazide by gastrogavage), the low dose QXG (QXG(L)) group (n = 11, administered with 9.26 g/kg QXG by gastrogavage), the middle dose QXG (QXG(M)) group (n = 11, administered with 18.52 g/kg QXG by gastrogavage), the high dose QXG (QXG(H)) group (n = 11, administered with 37.04 g/kg QXG by gastrogavage).

24376784,"Eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, both spontaneous and treatment-induced, is marked by the wildtype allele C of a single nucleotide polymorphism upstream of the IL28B gene, rs12979860. This favorable allele was recently described to be in linkage disequilibrium with the wildtype allele TT of a dinucleotide polymorphism, ss469415590, located within a new protein-coding gene. While the TT allele introduces a frame-shift and disrupts the open reading frame, only the variant allele, ΔG, creates a novel type III interferon (IFN) protein, IFN-λ4/IFNL4. Absence of IFNL4 is thus supposed to favor resolution of HCV infection. As to date IFNL4 mRNA transcription has only been investigated in polyI:C-stimulated primary human hepatocytes and not yet in HCV infection in vivo, this study analyzed IFNL4 mRNA expression in human liver biopsy specimens. Samples were obtained from patients with a broad panel of disorders including no liver disease, liver diseases of non-viral etiology, chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C. Hepatic IFNL4 transcripts were detectable exclusively in a subgroup of chronic hepatitis C patients (24/45). Their amounts were positively related to liver HCV RNA copy numbers (p = 0.0023, r = 0.56) suggesting that the hepatic viral load influences IFNL4 transcription irrespective of IFNL4 governing genotype. Both, the IFNL4 creating allele ΔG (p<0.0001) and actual IFNL4 transcription (p = 0.0015) were found to be correlated to the activation of IFN stimulatory genes (ISGs). By contrast, IFNL4 ss469415590 genotypes were not found to be related to IFN-λ2/3/IL28 or IFN-λ1/IL29 gene expression. In conclusion, this study is the first report on intrahepatic transcript levels of the recently discovered IFNL4 gene. Data indicate that HCV infection in particular might activate IFNL4 transcription in the liver. It provides a possible explanation as to why hepatitis C patients show ISG stimulation in their livers in the apparent absence of an induction of other IFN subtypes.",valid
22232611,"The mechanisms underlying vocal mimicry in animals remain an open question. Delphinidae are able to copy sounds from their environment that are not produced by conspecifics. Usually, these mimicries occur associated with the context in which they were learned. No reports address the question of separation between auditory memory formation and spontaneous vocal copying although the sensory and motor phases of vocal learning are separated in a variety of songbirds. Here we show that captive bottlenose dolphins produce, during their nighttime resting periods, non-dolphin sounds that they heard during performance shows. Generally, in the middle of the night, these animals produced vocal copies of whale sounds that had been broadcast during daily public shows. As their life history was fully known, we know that these captive dolphins had never had the opportunity to hear whale sounds before then. Moreover, recordings made before the whale sounds started being broadcast revealed that they had never emitted such sounds before. This is to our knowledge the first evidence for a separation between formation of auditory memories and the process of learning to produce calls that match these memories in a marine mammal. One hypothesis is that dolphins may rehearse some special events heard during the daytime and that they then express vocally what could be conceived as a more global memory. These results open the way for broader views on how animals might rehearse life events while resting or maybe dreaming.",valid

These data have contributed to our current understanding of how humans may benefit from contact with animals. However, the animal experience of these interactions is still an under-researched area. This paper addresses the welfare of dogs who participate in animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) to improve health in human recipients. This paper builds on previous work by Glenk (2017) and provides an updated review of the literature on therapy dog welfare published from 2017-2021. New advances in scientific methodology, such as the determination of salivary oxytocin, breath rate and tympanic membrane temperature, are analyzed regarding their value and limitations for research in AAIs. Moreover, welfare-related social and environmental factors (e.g., freedom of choice, exploration of novel environments, inequity aversion, individual development, working experience, relationship with handler and handler skills) that profoundly influence dog perception and well-being are reviewed and discussed. Accounting for the globally increasing interest and the number of dogs utilized in AAIs, safeguarding therapy dog well-being, and identifying situations, circumstances and protocols that may challenge animal welfare remains an emerging and crucial area of scientific effort.",valid

We now report for the first time that the quality of the collagen is modified by the formation of type I homotrimer. The homotrimer fibre has been reported to possess a reduced mechanical strength and mineralisation in bone. The presence of the latter therefore accounts for narrower disorganised collagen fibres and decreased mineralisation, and a reduction in mechanical stability of the osteoarthritic femoral head. These changes in the subchondral bone are likely to be of considerable importance in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.",valid

In Saudi Arabia mortality rate varies between 0.6% to 1.26%. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether demographic characteristics (age and gender) and non-communicable diseases (Hypertension and Diabetes mellitus) have a significant association with mortality in COVID-19 patients. Prior to data collection, an expedite approval was obtained from Institutional Review Board (IRB Log No: RC. RC20.09.10) in Al Habib Research Center at Dr. Sulaiman Al-Habib Medical Group, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This is a retrospective design where we used descriptive and inferential analysis to analyse the data. Binary logistic regression was done to study the association between comorbidities and mortality of COVID-19. 43 (86%) of the male patients were non-survivors while 7 (14%) of the female patients were survivors. The odds of non-survivors among hypertensive patients are 3.56 times higher than those who are not having a history of Hypertension (HTN). The odds of non-survivors among diabetic patients are 5.17 times higher than those who are not having a history of Diabetes mellitus (DM). The odds of non-survivors are 2.77 times higher among those who have a history of HTN and DM as compared to those who did not have a history of HTN and DM.

26993250,"A predisposing factor for development of the hyperglycaemic state of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is obesity. We previously showed that increasing maternal obesity is associated with significant reductions in placental mitochondrial respiration. MicroRNA (miR)-143 has been previously shown to regulate the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis in cancer tissues. We hypothesized that mitochondrial respiration is reduced and aerobic glycolysis is up-regulated via changes in miR-143 expression in the placenta of women with GDM. Placental tissue was collected at term from women with A1GDM (controlled by diet), A2GDM (controlled by medication) and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls (CTRL). miR-143 expression was measured by RT-PCR. Expression of mitochondrial complexes, transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator 1α (PGC1α) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), components of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling, glucose transporter GLUT1 and glycolytic enzymes [hexokinase-2 (HK-2), phosphofructokinase (PFK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] were measured by Western blot. Trophoblast respiration was measured by XF24 Analyser. Expression of miR-143, mitochondrial complexes, and PPARγ and PGC1α, which act downstream of miR-143, were significantly decreased in A2GDM placentae compared with A1GDM and CTRL (P<0.01). Placental hPL (human placental lactogen) levels, expression of glycolytic enzymes, GLUT1 and mTOR signalling were also significantly increased by more than 2-fold in A2GDM compared with A1GDM and CTRL (P<0.05). There was a 50% reduction in mitochondrial respiration in trophoblast cells isolated from A2GDM placentae. Overexpression of miR-143 was able to increase mitochondrial respiration, increase protein expression of mitochondrial complexes and decrease expression of glycolytic enzymes by 40% compared with A2GDM.

This study investigates the action of Te on immunity acquired against blood-stages of the malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi in female mice of the inbred strain C57BL/10. Our data show: (i) About 90% of mice infected with 10(6) P. chabaudi-infected erythrocytes are able to develop protective immune mechanisms which become evident in self-healing the infection. The capability of self-healing is lost when mice are pretreated with Te for 3 weeks. (ii) Mice which have self-healed infections acquire immunity to homologous rechallenge. Concomitantly, mice become Te-unresponsive in that their acquired immunity is not suppressible by Te-treatment. (iii) Flow cytometry reveals that Te-pretreatment entails an increase of CD8+ cells and a decrease of Ig+ cells by about 4% in spleens of non-immune mice. In immune mice, however, there is a Te-unresponsiveness of the percental distribution of splenic cell populations. (iv) Adoptive transfer experiments indicate that immunity is conferred by spleen cells, presumably non-T-cells. These cells are Te-unresponsive, since they exert their effect in Te-pretreated mice in the presence of Te. (v) Te-unresponsive immunity can be also transferred by serum, especially the IgG-fraction, obtained from immune mice. Our data demonstrate that Te prevents the development of protective immunity against P. chabaudi infections. However, when once established, protective immunity becomes unresponsive to Te. Our data suggest that the effector mechanisms of protective immunity involve Te-unresponsive B cells secreting protective IgG-antibodies.",valid

The blood sampling test showed no increase in tumor markers. Abdominal CT/MRI examination and abdominal echo examination showed multiple nodules from the origin of the left intrahepatic bile duct and intrahepatic bile duct dilation predominantly on the left side. No other findings indicating metastasis were found, including the PET-CT test. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed a poorly contrast-enhanced area in the B3 region, and intraluminal ultrasonography confirmed a mass that coincided with the poorly contrast-enhanced area and grew papillary. No tumor growth was observed in the other branches or common bile ducts, but all ducts were filled with suspended matter, which was thought to be mucus.

However, less is known about changes over time in socioeconomic differences in leisure-time physical activity and the reasons for the changes. We hypothesised that class differences in leisure-time physical activity would widen over time due to declining physical activity among the lower occupational classes. We examined whether occupational class differences in leisure-time physical activity change over time in a cohort of Finnish middle-aged women and men. We also examined whether a set of selected covariates could account for the observed changes. The data were derived from the Helsinki Health Study cohort mail surveys; the respondents were 40-60-year-old employees of the City of Helsinki at baseline in 2000-2002 (n = 8960, response rate 67%). Follow-up questionnaires were sent to the baseline respondents in 2007 (n = 7332, response rate 83%). The outcome measure was leisure-time physical activity, including commuting, converted to metabolic equivalent tasks (MET). Socioeconomic position was measured by occupational class (professionals, semi-professionals, routine non-manual employees and manual workers). The covariates included baseline age, marital status, limiting long-lasting illness, common mental disorders, job strain, physical and mental health functioning, smoking, body mass index, and employment status at follow-up. Firstly the analyses focused on changes over time in age adjusted prevalence of leisure-time physical activity. Secondly, logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for covariates of changes in occupational class differences in leisure-time physical activity. At baseline there were no occupational class differences in leisure-time physical activity. Over the follow-up leisure-time physical activity increased among those in the higher classes and decreased among manual workers, suggesting the emergence of occupational class differences at follow-up. Women in routine non-manual and manual classes and men in the manual class tended to be more often physically inactive in their leisure-time (<14 MET hours/week) and to be less often active (>30 MET hours/week) than those in the top two classes. Adjustment for the covariates did not substantially affect the observed occupational class differences in leisure-time physical activity at follow-up. Occupational class differences in leisure-time physical activity emerged over the follow-up period among both women and men.

This study compares the association of Prop 56 with smoking prevalence and smoking intensity across racial/ethnic groups, further examining distinctions across income subgroups within each racial/ethnic group. The study used pooled cross-sectional data from the 2012-2018 California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. We examined two outcomes: current smoking prevalence and smoking intensity conditional on current smoking. A two-part econometric model was used to estimate the association of Prop 56 with smoking prevalence and intensity using multiple logistic regression and multiple linear regression, respectively. The two-part model was run separately for all adults (full sample) and each racial/ethnic group. Within each racial/ethnic group, we ran stratified analyses by income subgroups. The results indicated that Prop 56 was negatively associated with smoking prevalence among full sample, Hispanic, White, and African American adults and negatively associated with smoking intensity among full sample and White smokers. Stratified analyses by race/ethnicity and income showed that Prop 56 was negatively associated with smoking prevalence among low-income full sample and White adults and among middle-income smokers in the full, Hispanic, White, African American, and Asian samples. Prop 56 was negatively associated with smoking intensity among middle-income Hispanic and high-income White smokers. The association between Prop 56 and smoking intensity was positive among high-income African American smokers. Prop 56 was associated with a reduction in smoking prevalence across multiple racial/ethnic groups, particularly within the low- and middle-income subgroups. Our findings indicate that the reduction in smoking prevalence immediately following the implementation of Prop 56 tobacco tax increase was significant across a variety racial/ethnic groups, particularly low- and middle-income subgroups. We found differential responses in smoking prevalence across income groups among Whites but not among racial/ethnic minorities. We found no evidence of any significance association between Proposition 56 and smoking intensity among minorities and economically vulnerable populations, except for middle-income Hispanics. Researchers, policy makers, and advocates should consider the additional merits of targeted, community-based, noneconomic tobacco control interventions in reaching low- and middle-income groups within racial/ethnic minorities.",valid

The surface morphology of the mild steel before and after corrosion (in 1.0 M HCl) was analyzed via scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDAX), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and thermodynamic studies. The weight loss measurement under different concentrations of EAD indicated that an excellent inhibition was displayed at a concentration of 0.001 M, and the IE was found to depend on both the concentration and molecular structure of EAD. A potentiodynamic polarization study revealed that EAD predominantly acted as a cathode inhibitor, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirmed the adsorption of EAD on the surface of mild steel, which obeyed Temkin's adsorption isotherm model.

During laterotrusive occlusal excursion (working side), each individual had to present canine guidance on one side and group function on the opposite side, without balancing-side contacts. Integrated EMG (IEMG) recordings were performed by placing bipolar surface electrodes on the right and left sternocleidomastoid muscles. IEMG activity was recorded seated upright with the head unsupported and in the right and the left lateral decubitus body positions (head, neck and body horizontally aligned), under the following experimental conditions: 1. Maximal voluntary clenching in the intercuspal position; 2. Laterotrusive occlusal excursion with canine guidance; 3. Laterotrusive occlusal excursion with group function. Bilateral sternocleidomastoid IEMG activity with canine guidance or group function was significantly lower than the intercuspal position in both body positions. In the seated upright position, significantly lower activity was observed with canine guidance than in group function.

31189975,"Glucocorticoids (Gcs) are widely prescribed anti-inflammatory compounds, which act through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Using an unbiased proteomics screen in lung tissue, we identified the membrane protein caveolin -1 (Cav1) as a direct interaction partner of the GR. In Cav1 knockout mice GR transactivates anti-inflammatory genes, including Dusp1, more than in controls. We therefore determined the role of Cav1 in modulating Gc action in two models of pulmonary inflammation. We first tested innate responses in lung. Loss of Cav1 impaired the inflammatory response to nebulized LPS, increasing cytokine/chemokine secretion from lung, but impairing neutrophil infiltration. Despite these changes to the inflammatory response, there was no Cav1 effect on anti-inflammatory capacity of Gcs. We also tested GR/Cav1 crosstalk in a model of allergic airway inflammation. Cav1 had a very mild effect on the inflammatory response, but no effect on the Gc response - with comparable immune cell infiltrate (macrophage, eosinophils, neutrophils), pathological score and PAS positive cells observed between both genotypes. Pursuing the Th2 adaptive immune response further we demonstrate that Cav1 knockout mice retained their ability to expel the intestinal nematode parasite T.muris, which requires adaptive Th2 immune response for elimination. Therefore, Cav1 regulates innate immune responses in the lung, but does not have an effect on Th2-mediated adaptive immunity in lung or gut. Although we demonstrate that Cav1 regulates GR transactivation of anti-inflammatory genes, this does not translate to an effect on suppression of inflammation in vivo.",valid
23673000,"Clinical studies and animal experimentation have shown that colonic inflammation is associated with an increased number and reactivity of platelets, coagulation abnormalities, and enhanced thrombus formation. The objective of this study was to define the contribution of IL-6 to the thrombocytosis, exaggerated agonist-induced platelet aggregation, and enhanced extra-intestinal thrombosis that occur during experimental colitis. The number of mature and immature platelets, platelet life span, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation response, and light/dye-induced thrombus formation in cremaster muscle arterioles were measured in wild-type (WT) and IL-6-deficient (IL-6(-/-)) mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. DSS colitis in WT mice was associated with thrombocytosis with an elevated number of both mature and immature platelets and no change in platelet life span. The thrombocytosis response was absent in IL-6(-/-) mice. DSS treatment also enhanced the platelet aggregation response to thrombin and accelerated thrombus development in WT mice, but not in IL-6(-/-) mice. Exogenous IL-6 administered to WT mice elicited a dose-dependent enhancement of thrombus formation. These findings indicate that IL-6 mediates the thrombocytosis, platelet hyperreactivity, and accelerated thrombus development associated with experimental colitis. The IL-6-dependent colitis-induced thrombocytosis appears to result from an enhancement of thrombopoiesis because platelet life span is unchanged.",valid

All target lesions underwent US/mp-MRI fusion biopsy and prostatic sampling was completed by US-guided systematic random 12-core biopsies. Histological analysis and Gleason score were established for all the samples, both target lesions defined by mp-MRI, and random biopsies. PI-RADS score was correlated with the histological results, divided in three groups (benign tissue, atypia and carcinoma) and with Gleason groups, divided in four categories considering the new Grading system of the ISUP 2014, using t test. Multivariate analysis was used to correlate PI-RADS and Gleason categories to PSA level and abnormalities axial diameter. When the random core biopsies showed carcinoma (mp-MRI false-negatives), PSA value and lesions Gleason median value were compared with those of carcinomas identified by mp-MRI (true-positives), using t test. There was statistically significant difference between PI-RADS score in carcinoma, atypia and benign lesions groups (4.41, 3.61 and 3.24, respectively) and between PI-RADS score in Gleason < 7 group and Gleason > 7 group (4.14 and 4.79, respectively). mp-MRI performance was more accurate for lesions > 15 mm and in patients with PSA > 6 ng/ml.

26905304,"African-American (AA) men tend to harbor high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) and exhibit worse outcomes when compared to other groups. It has been postulated that AA men may harbor more anterior prostate lesions (APLs) that are undersampled by the standard transrectal ultrasound guided-biopsy (SBx), potentially resulting in greater degree of Gleason score (GS) upgrading at radical prostatectomy. We aimed to evaluate the detection rate of anterior PCa significance of APLs in AA men on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and compare it to a matched cohort of White/Other (W/O) men. A review of 1,267 men who had an mpMRI with suspicious prostate lesions and who underwent magnetic resonance transrectal ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy (FBx) with concurrent SBx in the same biopsy session was performed. All AA men were matched to a control group of W/O using a 1:1 propensity score-matching algorithm with age, prostate-specific antigen, and prostate volume as matching variables. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of APLs in AA men. Of the 195 AA men who underwent mpMRI, 93 (47.7%) men had a total of 109 APLs. Prior negative SBx was associated with the presence of APLs in AA men (Odds ratio = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.03-3.20; P = 0.04). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, smaller prostate (P = 0.001) and rising prostate-specific antigen (P = 0.007) were independent predictors of cancer-positive APLs in AA men. Comparative analysis of AA (93/195, 47.7%) vs. W/O (100/194, 52%) showed no difference in the rates of APLs (P = 0.44) or in cancer detection rate within those lesions or the distribution of GS within those cancers (P = 0.63) despite an overall higher cancer detection rate in AA men (AA: 124/195 [63.6%] vs. W/O: 97/194 [50.0%], P = 0.007). In cases where APLs were positive for PCa on FBx, the GS of APL was equal to the highest GS of the entire gland in 82.9% (29/35) and 90.9% (30/33) of the time in AA and W/O men, respectively. Cancer-positive APLs represented the highest risk GS in most cases. AA men with prior negative SBx are twice as likely to harbor a concerning APL. In our cohort, AA and W/O men had comparable rates of APLs on mpMRI. Thus, differences in APLs do not explain the higher risk of AA men for deahth due to PCa. However, targeting of APLs via FBx can clinically improve PCa risk stratification and guide appropriate treatment options.",valid

15309301,"Anthracnose fruit rot is an economically important disease that affects pepper production in Indonesia. Strong resistance to two causal pathogens, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. capsici, was found in an accession of Capsicum chinense. The inheritance of this resistance was studied in an F(2) population derived from a cross of this accession with an Indonesian hot pepper variety ( Capsicum annuum) using a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approach. In laboratory tests where ripe fruits were artificially inoculated with either C. gloeosporioides or C. capsici, three resistance-related traits were scored: the infection frequency, the true lesion diameter (averaged over all lesions that actually developed), and the overall lesion diameter (averaged over all inoculation points, including those that did not develop lesions). One main QTL was identified with highly significant and large effects on all three traits after inoculation with C. gloeosporioides and on true lesion diameter after inoculation with C. capsici. Three other QTL with smaller effects were found for overall lesion diameter and true lesion diameter after inoculation with C. gloeosporioides, two of which also had an effect on infection frequency. Interestingly, the resistant parent carried a susceptible allele for a QTL for all three traits that was closely linked to the main QTL. The results with C. capsici were based on less observations and therefore less informative. Although the main QTL was shown to have an effect on true lesion diameter after inoculation with C. capsici, no significant QTL were identified for overall lesion diameter or infection frequency.",valid
28604691,"ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers modulate nucleosome dynamics by mobilizing or disassembling nucleosomes, as well as altering nucleosome composition. These chromatin remodellers generally function by translocating along nucleosomal DNA at the H3-H4 interface of nucleosomes. Here we show that, unlike other remodellers, INO80 translocates along DNA at the H2A-H2B interface of nucleosomes and persistently displaces DNA from the surface of H2A-H2B. DNA translocation and DNA torsional strain created near the entry site of nucleosomes by INO80 promotes both the mobilization of nucleosomes and the selective exchange of H2A.Z-H2B dimers out of nucleosomes and replacement by H2A-H2B dimers without any additional histone chaperones. We find that INO80 translocates and mobilizes H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes more efficiently than those containing H2A, partially accounting for the preference of INO80 to replace H2A.Z with H2A. Our data suggest that INO80 has a mechanism for dimer exchange that is distinct from other chromatin remodellers including its paralogue SWR1.",valid
22511806,"Association mapping (AM), also known as linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping, is a viable approach to overcome limitations of pedigree-based quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. In AM, genotypic and phenotypic correlations are investigated in unrelated individuals. Unlike QTL mapping, AM takes advantage of both LD and historical recombination present within the gene pool of an organism, thus utilizing a broader reference population. In plants, AM has been used in model species with available genomic resources. Pursuing AM in tree species requires both genotyping and phenotyping of large populations with unique architectures. Recently, genome sequences and genomic resources for forest and fruit crops have become available. Due to abundance of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a genome, along with availability of high-throughput resequencing methods, SNPs can be effectively used for genotyping trees. In addition to DNA polymorphisms, copy number variations (CNVs) in the form of deletions, duplications, and insertions also play major roles in control of expression of phenotypic traits. Thus, CNVs could provide yet another valuable resource, beyond those of microsatellite and SNP variations, for pursuing genomic studies. As genome-wide SNP data are generated from high-throughput sequencing efforts, these could be readily reanalysed to identify CNVs, and subsequently used for AM studies. However, forest and fruit crops possess unique architectural and biological features that ought to be taken into consideration when collecting genotyping and phenotyping data, as these will also dictate which AM strategies should be pursued. These unique features as well as their impact on undertaking AM studies are outlined and discussed.",valid

21481089,"To evaluate the influence of surgical versus natural menopause on sexual dysfunction, and the role of androgens in that context. Sexual functioning and androgen levels were studied in 35 surgically and 83 naturally menopausal women. Sexual dysfunction was defined as a total score of less than 23 on the Female Sexual Function Index. Sexual dysfunction was significantly more common in surgically than in naturally menopausal women (65.7% vs 44.6%; P = 0.036). The mean total testosterone level in women with sexual dysfunction was significantly lower than that in their counterparts (49.3 ± 21.0 vs 58.8 ± 23.6 ng/mL; P = 0.022). On the other hand, androgen levels did not differ significantly between surgically and naturally menopausal women.

While the duration of menopause was significantly longer in surgically menopausal women, this co-factor was not an independent predictor of sexual dysfunction.

806523,"An immunochemical and functional analysis of the classical and alternate complement pathways in human serum was performed in the presence of 10 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and MgCl(2)-EGTA (MgEGTA), chelating agents which have been recently utilized as a means of distinguishing between these two complement pathways. Total hemolytic activity, integrity of the C1 complex, hemolytic activity of C2, conversion of factor B (C3 proactivator), and complement-dependent bactericidal activity were studied. The effect of these chelators on activation of complement pathways by Escherichia coli, by sensitized erythrocytes as a prototype of activators of the classical pathway, and by zymosan as a prototype of alternate (properdin) pathway activators was studied. Human serum containing 10 mM EGTA, which provides almost no ionized calcium and considerably less ionized magnesium than unchelated serum, allowed consumption of complement via the alternate (properdin) pathway, but blocked the classical pathway as judged by disintegration of the C1 complex and lack of utilization of C2. However, activity of the alternate complement pathway in EGTA serum, as judged by conversion of factor B and bactericidal activity against gram-negative bacteria, was distinctly suboptimal. Addition of magnesium ion in a concentration equimolar to EGTA (MgEGTA serum), while still providing conditions in which the C1 complex dissociated, significantly enhanced alternate complement pathway-mediated bactericidal activity. However, in MgEGTA serum considerable fluid-phase activation of the alternate pathway, as indicated by decrease in 50% hemolytic complement (CH(5 0)) titers and conversion of factor B to its active form in the absence of any activating challenge, was observed. Moreover, some fluid-phase consumption of C2 was observed in MgEGTA serum, even though, as mentioned, the C1 complex was shown to be dissociated under these conditions. MgEGTA-related activation of C2 and of the alternate (properdin) pathway of complement was significantly enhanced by the presence of zymosan and E. coli. These results indicate that use of the chelating agents EGTA and MgEGTA to differentiate between classical and alternate pathway activation of human complement is more complex than has hitherto been suggested. In EGTA serum, spontaneous activation of either pathway does not occur but bactericidal activity, as a measure of biologic function of complement, is suboptimal. In MgEGTA serum, bactericidal activity is fully expressed, but there is considerable instability, in terms of fluid-phase activation, in Mg(2+)-dependent components of both pathways. Thus, caution is indicated in the use and interpretation of the effects of these chelating agents on biologic functions mediated by either pathway of human complement.",valid

We evaluated the role of any non-breast milk feeds, excluding prescribed medicines on stool microbial communities via 16S rRNA gene sequencing, peripheral T-cell activation via flow cytometry, and buccal mucosal gene expression via quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. A total of 155 infants were recruited at birth with mean gestational age of 38.9 weeks and mean birth weight of 3.2 kg. All infants were exclusively breastfed (EBF) at birth, but only 43.5% and 20% remained EBF at 6 or 14 weeks of age, respectively. We observed lower stool microbial diversity and distinct microbial composition in exclusively breastfed infants. These microbial communities, and the relative abundance of key taxa, were correlated with peripheral CD4+ T-cell activation, which was lower in EBF infants. In the oral mucosa, gene expression of chemokine and chemokine receptors involved in recruitment of HIV target cells to tissues, as well as epithelial cytoskeletal proteins, was lower in EBF infants. These data suggest that nonexclusive breastfeeding alters the gut microbiota, increasing T-cell activation and, potentially, mucosal recruitment of HIV target cells.

Advancing age is associated with not only less severe Graves' hyperthyroidism but also self-reported stress. We tested the hypothesis whether advancing age is associated with less exposure to stress, resulting in a lower immunological response, and less severe Graves' hyperthyroidism. Cross-sectional multicenter study. Two hundred and sixty-three consecutive untreated patients with a first episode of Graves' hyperthyroidism were included. The severity of Graves' hyperthyroidism was evaluated biochemically (freeT(4)-index and freeT(3)-index, thyrotropin-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII)) and clinically by the hyperthyroid symptom scale score (HSS score). Stress exposure was quantitated by three questionnaires. Advancing age was associated with less severe Graves' hyperthyroidism, both biochemically by lower serum freeT(3)-index and freeT(4)-index (P<0.01), lower serum TBII (P=0.05), and clinically by lower HSS scores (P=0.04) and smaller goiter size (P<0.01). FreeT(3)-index and freeT(4)-index were directly associated with HSS scores (P<0.01). Stress scores were associated with HSS scores (P<0.01) but not with biochemical severity of Graves' hyperthyroidism. Advancing age was associated with lower scores for stress exposure. Multivariate regression analysis showed that HSS score was independently related to the tendency to report negative feelings (P<0.01) but not to other stress scores and also not to age. Advancing age is associated with less exposure to stress, lower serum TBII and less severe clinical and biochemical Graves' hyperthyroidism. Because no direct relationship exists between stress exposure and TBII or freeT(3)-index and freeT(4)-index, we reject our hypothesis that less stress is causally related to biochemically less severe Graves' hyperthyroidism in old age. HSS score is primarily determined by negative feelings and not by age.",valid
10556205,"To date, the normal transcriptional regulation of the human beta-globin gene cluster has been recapitulated most accurately in transgenic mice that carry large yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) or ligated cosmid constructs. However, these large transgenes still exhibit variegated expression levels, perhaps because they tend to rearrange upon integration, or because the cloning vectors remain attached to the globin inserts. To try to circumvent these potential problems, we investigated the transgenic properties of a 100-kb DNA fragment containing the entire human beta-globin cluster propagated in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). We created 9 independent mouse lines, each carrying 1 to 6 copies of the human beta-globin cluster without the attached BAC vector. Five of the lines carry unrearranged copies of the cluster. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of adult F(1) mice showed that 2 lines express human beta globin at levels approximately equivalent to the endogenous mouse beta-major genes. One line expresses no human beta globin, while the remaining 6 lines show intermediate expression levels. Complete gamma-->beta-globin gene switching occurs, but is slightly delayed with respect to the endogenous mouse embryonic-->adult switch. Since these data are similar to what has been obtained using globin YACs or ligated cosmids, we conclude that (1) globin transgenes propagated in BACs are no less likely to rearrange than their cosmid or YAC counterparts, and (2) the retention of YAC vector sequences in a transgene probably has no significant impact on globin expression when using constructs of this size.",valid

Only the N-POMC antiserum significantly diminished adrenal mitotic activity 14 and 21 days after enucleation (P less than 0.01 and 0.05 respectively) when compared with NRS-treated enucleated rats, whereas plasma corticosterone levels in rats 14 days after enucleation were significantly (P less than 0.005) decreased only by treatment with ACTH antiserum. To determine whether the mitogenic N-POMC peptides involved in adrenal regeneration originated from the pituitary intermediate lobe, 0.9% (w/v) NaCl or ergocryptine (10 mg/kg body weight) was administered s.c. twice daily to rats between 7 and 13 days after enucleation. On day 14, adrenal mitotic activity and plasma levels of ACTH and N-POMC were not significantly different between ergocryptine and saline-treated enucleated rats, whereas alpha-MSH levels in ergocryptine-treated enucleated rats were significantly (P less than 0.02) decreased. Increases in N-POMC content of the pituitary lobe accompanied those of ACTH in animals 7, 10, 14 and 21 days after enucleation (P less than 0.01 compared with sham-treatment). Anterior lobes from rats 10 days after enucleation or from adrenalectomized rats showed raised ACTH and N-POMC levels compared with sham-treated animals, whereas alpha-MSH content in the anterior lobe of enucleated rats was significantly (P less than 0.005) decreased. Adrenalectomized animals had raised (P less than 0.005) amounts of alpha-MSH compared with sham-treated animals. Plasma levels of ACTH and N-POMC were significantly (P less than 0.01) raised in rats 10 days after enucleation or in adrenalectomized rats compared with those in sham-treated animals, whereas alpha-MSH levels were raised (P less than 0.005) only in adrenalectomized rats.

38097750,"Post-procedural quality control of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is emphasized in guidelines. However, this process can be tedious and time-consuming. Recently, a pre-training model called generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) on a public natural language processing platform has emerged and garnered significant attention, whose capabilities align well with the post-procedural quality control process and have the potential to streamline it. Therefore, we developed a simple program utilizing this platform and evaluated its performance. Esophageal ESDs were retrospectively included. The manual quality control process was performed and act as reference standard. GPT's prompt was optimized through multiple iterations. A Python program was developed to automatically submit prompt with pathological report of each ESD procedure and collect quality control information provided by GPT. Its performance on quality control was evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score. 165 cases were involved into the dataset, of which 5 were utilized as the prompt optimization dataset and 160 as the validation dataset. Definitive prompt was achieved through seven iterations. Time spent on the validation dataset by GPT was 13.47 ± 2.43 min. Accuracies of pathological diagnosis, invasion depth, horizontal margin, vertical margin, vascular invasion, and lymphatic invasion of the quality control program were (0.940, 0.952) (95% CI), (0.925, 0.945) (95% CI), 0.931, 1.0, and 1.0, respectively. Precisions were (0.965, 0.969) (95% CI), (0.934, 0.954) (95% CI), and 0.957 for pathological diagnosis, invasion depth, and horizontal margin, respectively. Recalls were (0.940, 0.952) (95% CI), (0.925, 0.945) (95% CI), and 0.931 for factors as mentioned, respectively. F1-score were (0.945, 0.957) (95% CI), (0.928, 0.948) (95% CI), and 0.941 for factors as mentioned, respectively.

Usually the clinical presentation is with fever, chills, hepatic mass. The fine needle biopsy shows a large amount of inflammatory cells, while the most common imaging techniques are not specific and do not reach a definitive preoperative diagnosis between a benign and a malignant tumor. From the examination of the Literature, the Authors found a mortality rate of 40% among patients treated by antibiotic therapy, while surgical procedures were successful in all but one case.

17470000,"How do people judge the monetary value of objects? One clue is provided by the typical endowment study (D. Kahneman, J. L. Knetsch, & R. H. Thaler, 1991), in which participants are randomly given either a good, such as a coffee mug, that they may later sell (""sellers"") or a choice between the good and amounts of cash (""choosers""). Sellers typically demand at least twice as much as choosers, inconsistent with economic theory. This result is usually explained by an increased weighting of losses, or loss aversion. The authors provide a memory-based account of endowment, suggesting that people construct values by posing a series of queries whose order differs for sellers and choosers. Because of output interference, these queries retrieve different aspects of the object and the medium of exchange, producing different valuations. The authors show that the content and structure of the recalled aspects differ for selling and choosing and that these aspects predict valuations. Merely altering the order in which queries are posed can eliminate the endowment effect, and changing the order of queries can produce endowment-like effects without ownership.",valid
35975700,"Legume nodules are symbiotic structures formed as a result of the interaction with rhizobia. Nodules fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia that is assimilated by the plant and this process requires strict metabolic regulation and signaling. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are involved as signal molecules at all stages of symbiosis, from rhizobial infection to nodule senescence. Also, reactive sulfur species (RSS) are emerging as important signals for an efficient symbiosis. Homeostasis of reactive molecules is mainly accomplished by antioxidant enzymes and metabolites and is essential to allow redox signaling while preventing oxidative damage. Here, we examine the metabolic pathways of reactive molecules and antioxidants with an emphasis on their functions in signaling and protection of symbiosis. In addition to providing an update of recent findings while paying tribute to original studies, we identify several key questions. These include the need of new methodologies to detect and quantify ROS, RNS, and RSS, avoiding potential artifacts due to their short lifetimes and tissue manipulation; the regulation of redox-active proteins by post-translational modification; the production and exchange of reactive molecules in plastids, peroxisomes, nuclei, and bacteroids; and the unknown but expected crosstalk between ROS, RNS, and RSS in nodules.",valid

The MHC2TA-168A>G (rs3087456), 1614C>G (rs4774), and 2536G>A (rs2229320) single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped using 5' exonuclease TaqMan genotyping assays in a group of 202 patients, who underwent coronary artery stenting. Basal and procedure coronary angiography were analyzed, looking for angiographic predictors of restenosis and follow-up angiography was performed to screen for binary restenosis. The results obtained in this study showed that the frequency of the three polymorphisms studied was similar in patients with and without restenosis. Univariate analysis showed that the use of drug-eluting stent (DES) reduces the risk of developing restenosis (p<0.001, OR=0.26). In contrast, the diameter<2.5mm of the stent and bifurcations increased the risk of developing restenosis (p=0.049, OR=1.74 and p=0.041, OR=1.8).

3922797,"Removal of long-chain asparagine-linked carbohydrates leads to loss of receptor-effector coupling in gonadotropin target tissue. This implies a direct interaction between carbohydrate and cell membrane components. To examine other mechanisms by which carbohydrate could activate post-receptor events, we have used sequence-specific and conformation-specific alpha-subunit radioimmunoassays as probes for conformational changes in deglycosylated choriogonadotropin and follitropin. Immunoreactivity of either hormone was enhanced 8-13-fold after removal of carbohydrate by anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Removal of sialic acid alone had little effect on reactivity. Based on the specificity of the antisera, the effect could be localized to a region in the amino-terminus remote in the linear sequence from actual sites of carbohydrate attachment. The results suggest that a conformational change in the alpha-subunit could account, at least in part, for the observed effects of deglycosylation on glycoprotein hormone action.",valid
9888702,"Hepatic angiomyolipoma (AML) is frequently misdiagnosed. HMB-45 is a promising immunomarker for this tumor that leads to recognition of some AMLs with unusual morphology. The purpose of this collaborative study is to better define the morphologic variations of AML. Thirty AMLs were examined, including four biopsy specimens and two fine-needle aspirates. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of HMB-45-positive myoid cells. Almost half the cases were originally misdiagnosed as carcinomas or sarcomas. There was marked female predominance (25:5), and the mean age was 48.7 years (range 29-68). Three patients (10%) had evidence of tuberous sclerosis and all had renal AML. According to the line of differentiation and predominance of tissue components, the tumors was subcategorized into mixed, lipomatous (> or = 70% fat), myomatous (< or = 10% fat), and angiomatous type. The mixed type was the most common (11 resected cases), comprising sheets of epithelioid muscle cells admixed with islands of adipocytes, abnormal vessels, and frequently, hematopoietic cells. Six tumors (including three from biopsy specimens) were heavily fatty and showed predominantly adipocytes with epithelioid and short spindle myoid cells webbed between fat cells. Of 10 myomatous AMLs, five tumors showed a pure sinusoidal trabecular pattern and comprised mainly epithelioid cells. Typically, mature adipocytes were absent or scanty, but fat was seen as fine droplets within cytoplasm or as occasional large globules in sinusoids. Pelioid and inflammatory pseudotumor-like patterns were identified focally. Regarding cellular features of the myoid cells, most of the epithelioid cells were either eosinophilic or clear with spiderweb cell morphology. Three AMLs showed an almost purely oncocytic appearance with scanty fat. Large pleomorphic epithelioid cells existed as small foci. Spindle cells arranged in long fascicles were uncommon. D-PAS-positive globules were common around pelioid areas. Brown pigments with staining characteristics of hemosiderin and/or melanin were noted. In conclusion, we propose HMB-45-positive myoid cells as the defining criterion of hepatic AML, which is a tumor capable of dual myomatous and lipomatous differentiation and melanogenesis. Because of its protean morphologic appearance, recognition of the various variant patterns and cell types is important for a correct diagnosis, assisted by immunohistochemical confirmation with HMB-45. Trabecular and oncocytic cell tumors appear to stand out as distinctive subtypes.",valid
27734227,"During epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), epithelial cells lose key phenotypic markers (e.g., E-cadherin and cytokeratin 18) and acquire mesenchymal markers (e.g., N-cadherin and vimentin). Although the loss of cytokeratin 18 is a hallmark of EMT, the regulatory role of cytokeratin 18 in EMT is not yet fully understood. Here, we report that cytokeratin 18 is involved in the regulation of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1)-induced EMT in breast epithelial cells. When MCF10A cells were treated with TGF-β1 for 24 h, considerable morphological changes, indicative of the early stages of EMT (e.g., loss of cell-cell contact), were observed and cytokeratin 18 was downregulated. However, E-cadherin levels were not altered until a later time point. This suggests that cytokeratin 18 may play an active role during the earlier stages of EMT. Consistent with this notion, siRNA-mediated knockdown of cytokeratin 18 delayed TGF-β1-mediated EMT, and the associated downregulation of E-cadherin reduced the phosphorylation/nuclear localization of smad 2/3 and decreased the expression levels of snail and slug (which inhibit E-cadherin expression in epithelial cells as an early response to TGF-β1). Taken together, these results suggest that cytokeratin 18 critically contributes to initiating TGF-β1-induced EMT via the smad 2/3-mediated regulation of snail and slug expression in breast epithelial cells.",valid

The present study aimed to explore the perceptions of patients who have been recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes regarding nutrition care received from dietitians. Ten individuals recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes participated in three individual semi-structured qualitative telephone interviews: at baseline, then at 3 and 6 months after recruitment. Data were analysed using content analysis at each time point and meta-synthesis of findings over time. Participants' initial interactions with dietitians were challenging and overwhelming as a result of the instructional nature of consultations. Many participants questioned the use of dietary guidelines to inform nutrition care because this was not adapted to the individual. Some participants valued receiving education on topics such as label reading and serving sizes; however, others considered that the nutrition care was rushed and overly directive. Very few participants perceived that an ongoing relationship with a dietitian would be useful, and limited interaction was planned beyond 6 months after diagnosis. These findings suggest that there is considerable opportunity for dietitians to enhance the nutrition care provided to patients with type 2 diabetes. Tailoring of dietary guidelines to individuals, utilising supportive counselling styles, and focusing on open communication in consultations that facilitate ongoing, useful care for patients, may help patients with type 2 diabetes achieve and maintain healthy dietary behaviours.",valid
2182015,"Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) has been implicated by in vitro studies as an inhibitor of insulin-stimulated glucose utilization by skeletal muscle cells and also as an inhibitor of insulin-stimulated insulin secretion by beta cells. Increased expression and production of IAPP by beta cells, as has been suggested to occur in cats with impaired glucose tolerance, could thus contribute substantially to the development of the insulin resistance and impaired insulin release which are the hallmarks of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The effects of IAPP with respect to glucose metabolism in living animals, however, have not been previously reported. In the present in vivo study we show that synthetic amidated IAPP induced impaired glucose tolerance in each of the 3 cats studied, with dramatic impairment (increases in glucose to T1/2 values of 124% and 234%) in 2 of the 3 cats. Impaired insulin responses were also evident in the 2 cats with the most dramatic states of glucose intolerance.

Mutation of the distinct binding sites for TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and for TRAF 2, 3, and 5 in the CD40 cytoplasmic domain revealed their independent contributions to DC maturation and activation of NF-kappaB. In contrast, disruption of the TRAF6 but not the TRAF 2,3,5 binding site markedly decreased IL-12 p40 secretion along with p38 and JNK activation in response to CD154 stimulation.

18353413,"There has been an increased appreciation over the last 20 years that chemical agents at very low dose levels can produce biological responses in protein expression patterns (proteomic responses) or alterations in sensitive metabolic pathways (metabolomic responses). Marked improvements in analytical methodologies, such as 2-D gel electrophoresis, matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and surface enhanced laser desorption-time of flight (SELDI-TOF) technologies are capable of identifying specific protein patterns related to exposure to chemicals either alone or as mixtures. The detection and interpretation of early cellular responses to chemical agents have also made great advances through correlative ultrastructural morphometric and biochemical studies. Similarly, advances in analytical technologies such as HPLC, proton NMR, MALDI-TOF, and SELDI-TOF have permitted early detection of changes in a number of essential metabolic pathways following chemical exposures by measurement of alterations in metabolic products from those pathways. Data from these approaches are increasingly regarded as potentially useful biomarkers of chemical exposure and early cellular responses. Validation and establishment of linkages to biological outcomes are needed in order for biomarkers of effect to be established.

Understanding the relationship between psychological and social factors and adolescent spinal pain may be important in both the prevention and treatment of spinal pain in this age group. We aimed to determine if psychological and social factors were associated with spinal pain in a cross-sectional study of a school-based cohort of 1279 Danish adolescents aged 11-13, who were categorized into ""any"" and ""substantial"" spinal pain. ""Substantial spinal pain"" was defined as a lifetime frequency of ""sometimes"" or ""often"" and a pain intensity of at least two on the revised Faces Pain Scale. Logistic regression analyses, stratified by sex, were conducted for single and all variables together. Eighty-six percent of participants reported ""any spinal pain"" and 28% reported ""substantial spinal pain"". Frequency of psychological and social factors was significantly higher in those with spinal pain compared to those without. As the frequency of psychological and social factors increased, the odds of both ""any spinal pain"" and ""substantial spinal pain"" also increased.Conclusion: Psychological and social factors may be important determinants in adolescent spinal pain. What is Known: • Spinal pain begins early in life to reach adult levels by age 18. Spinal pain in adolescence is strongly associated with spinal pain in adulthood. • In adults, psychological and social factors and spinal pain are strongly related; however, this relationship in adolescence is poorly understood. What is New: • Adolescents with spinal pain reported a significantly higher frequency of psychological factors and loneliness and lower levels of pupil acceptance. • Adolescents reporting higher levels of loneliness, lower levels of pupil acceptance, and increased frequency of psychological factors had increased odds of reporting ""substantial spinal pain"".",valid
11369201,"Mitosis involves the interaction of many different components, including chromatin, microtubules, and motor proteins. Dissecting the mechanics of mitosis requires methods of studying not just each component in isolation, but also the entire ensemble of components in its full complexity in genetically tractable model organisms. We have developed a mathematical framework for analyzing motion in four-dimensional microscopy data sets that allows us to measure elasticity, viscosity, and forces by tracking the conformational movements of mitotic chromosomes. We have used this approach to measure, for the first time, the basic biophysical parameters of mitosis in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster embryos. We found that Drosophila embryo chromosomes are significantly less rigid than the much larger chromosomes of vertebrates. Anaphase kinetochore force and nucleoplasmic viscosity were comparable with previous estimates in other species. Motion analysis also allowed us to measure the magnitude of the polar ejection force exerted on chromosome arms during metaphase by individual microtubules. We find the magnitude of this force to be approximately 1 pN, a number consistent with force generation either by collision of growing microtubules with chromosomes or by single kinesin motors. Motion analysis allows noninvasive mechanical measurements to be made in complex systems. This approach should allow the functional effects of Drosophila mitotic mutants on chromosome condensation, kinetochore forces, and the polar ejection force to be determined.",valid

Using a 14 item questionnaire we prospectively surveyed all the epileptologists across Canada with regards to current use, perceived benefits and barriers to the use of telemedicine. The survey was mailed out to 76 neurologists who had a primary interest in epilepsy. We received 39 responses (54.1%) spanning seven provinces. Majority of the responders were 50 years and over (56.4%). Although 61.5% of the physicians acknowledged a need for tele-epilepsy services, the majority (64.1%) had not used telemedicine. The most common forms of technology were videoconferencing and telephone but some physicians had also used email. Telemedicine was mainly used for clinical and educational purposes. 79.5% of physicians had access to videoconferencing equipment and 61.5% assessed that there was a need/use for clinical telehealth. The main perceived obstacles in the use of telemedicine were: lack of infrastructure support and remuneration problems followed by limitations in clinical examination. Although widely available, telemedicine is under-utilized in epilepsy care. Most of the obstacles can be easily fixed and overcome through education and simple interventions.

We conducted a retrospective database review in the setting of a University hospital on 281 consecutive adult patients admitted to emergency admission, cardiac catheterization laboratory or intensive care units for resuscitation from non-traumatic cardiac arrest. The first available potassium value was evaluated. The mean potassium level was 3.9 ± 0.9 mmol/l and thus within the reference range of 3.5-5.0 mmol/l, but the overall prevalence of hypokalaemia was high (31.0%). Moderate rather than severe hypokalaemia was typically observed, with 95% of patients exhibiting potassium levels above 2.7 mmol/l. Among those six patients with extreme hypokalaemia defined as a potassium levels below the 2.5 percentile, two adult females were identified to suffer from previously untreated body scheme disorder with furosemide abuse (potassium 1.1 and 1.4 mmol/l). Another patient (potassium 2.1 mmol/l) suffered from poorly controlled bulimia nervosa and acute diarrhoea due to GI infection and one (potassium 2.4 mmol/l) from untreated bulimic anorexia. In contrast to moderately reduced potassium which is a frequent finding in adult patients at the time of admission for non-traumatic cardiac arrest, severe hypokalaemia is uncommon.

The stereochemistry of the major diasteromeric bis(gem-dimethylcyclopropane) adduct has now been assigned as [(1RS,3RS)-2,2-dimethyl-3-phenylcyclopropyl][(1SR,3SR)-2,2-dimethyl-3-phenylcyclopropyl]methanone, C(23)H(26)O, by X-ray crystallographic studies on a twinned crystal. The asymmetric unit contains two molecules of the adduct, the conformations of which differ in the orientation of the phenyl ring relative to the adjacent cyclopropanated double bond. The carbonyl groups of each adduct are aligned approximately along the a axis and in opposite directions to each other. The molecules pack to give a sinusoidal pattern along the b axis. This is the first acyclic bis(dimethylcyclopropyl) ketone for which an X-ray crystal structure determination has been reported, and is also the first bis-cyclopropanated dba analogue. The knowledge that the major diastereomer has the meso structure (and therefore the confirmation that the minor isomer is the racemate) will prove invaluable in future studies to utilize bis(dimethylcyclopropyl) ketones as reagents, in rearrangement processes, and as potential ligands and ligand precursors in organometallic chemistry.",valid
26203921,"In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the functional networks in professional composers during the creation of music. We compared the composing state and resting state imagery of 17 composers and found that the functional connectivity of primary networks in the bilateral occipital lobe and bilateral postcentral cortex decreased during the composing period. However, significantly stronger functional connectivity appeared between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the right angular gyrus and the bilateral superior frontal gyrus during composition. These findings indicate that a specific brain state of musical creation is formed when professional composers are composing, in which the integration of the primary visual and motor areas is not necessary. Instead, the neurons of these areas are recruited to enhance the functional connectivity between the ACC and the default mode network (DMN) to plan the integration of musical notes with emotion.",valid

18813987,"To prevent unnecessary errors and adverse results of laparoscopic surgery, proper training is of paramount importance. A safe way to train surgeons for laparoscopic skills is simulation. For this purpose traditional box trainers are often used, however they lack objective assessment of performance. Virtual reality laparoscopic simulators assess performance, but lack realistic haptic feedback. Augmented reality (AR) combines a virtual reality (VR) setting with real physical materials, instruments, and feedback. This article presents the current developments in augmented reality laparoscopic simulation. Pubmed searches were performed to identify articles regarding surgical simulation and augmented reality. Identified companies manufacturing an AR laparoscopic simulator received the same questionnaire referring to the features of the simulator. Seven simulators that fitted the definition of augmented reality were identified during the literature search. Five of the approached manufacturers returned a completed questionnaire, of which one simulator appeared to be VR and was therefore not applicable for this review. Several augmented reality simulators have been developed over the past few years and they are improving rapidly. We recommend the development of AR laparoscopic simulators for component tasks of procedural training. AR simulators should be implemented in current laparoscopic training curricula, in particular for laparoscopic suturing training.",valid

During a follow-up study for chronic hepatitis C in a 71-year-old man, a nodular lesion showed rapid growth from 1 cm to 4 cm in diameter within 3 months. Histologically, the tumor was consistent with moderately differentiated HCC, but was intermingled with nests of small round cells with scarce cytoplasm, which resembled those found in small cell carcinoma. This population formed small solid nests among the trabecular structures. Immunohistochemically the small round cell component of the tumor was strongly positive for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), chromogranin A and synaptophysin, but hepatocyte paraffin-1 (HP-1) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were negative. In contrast, HP-1 and AFP were positive, and NSE, chromogranin A and synaptophysin were negative in moderately differentiated HCC tissues. Electron microscopy revealed many intracytoplasmic neurosecretory granules in the small round cells. The labeling indexes of p53 and Ki-67 were significantly higher in the small round cell component than in the moderately differentiated HCC component.

From August 1994 onwards, 285 HIV positive children were referred to the HIV clinic. These included those intramural deliveries born to HIV positive mothers, those referred from other centers with a positive HIV ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test and those screened routinely at our center in view of transfusion dependence and found to be HIV positive. After informed consent from either parent, the HIV status of all referred patients was retested by ELISA. Two hundred and thirteen (74.73%) patients were below the age of five years. Vertical transmission as the route of infection was documented in 247 (86.66%), 33 (11.57%) were infected through blood and in 5 (1.75%), the mode of transmission could not be ascertained. The clinical features noted were protein energy malnutrition in 127 (44.56%), pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis in 84 (29.47%), hepatosplenomegaly in 82 (28.77%), persistent generalized lymphadenopathy in 67 (23.50%), skin lesions in 63 (22.10%), chronic diarrhea in 43 (15.08%), oral thrush in 42 (14.73%), pyrexia of unknown origin in 36 (12.63%), chronic lung disease in 32 (11.22%), chronic hypertrophic parotitis in 27 (9.47%), chronic ottorrhea in 26 (9.12%), recurrent lower respiratory tract infection in 24 (8.42%), neurological manifestations of non-tuberculous origin in 13 (4.56%) and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in 11(3.88%).

9301057,"Temporal resolution was examined as a function of frequency region and listening region. The first experiment demonstrated that amplitude- and frequency-modulated tones are not appropriate stimuli to study temporal resolution as a functional of frequency region, due to the availability of other cues in addition to temporal ones. In the other experiments, thresholds for detection of sinusoidal amplitude modulation of a noise band were measured as a function of frequency region, bandwidth, and level of surrounding notched noise masker. Temporal modulation transfer functions (TMTFs) measured in low- and high-frequency regions did not differ in sensitivity or in cutoff frequency, suggesting that initial ""critical band"" filtering did not affect temporal resolution. When the upper cutoff frequency of the noise was held constant, TMTF sensitivity increased with noise bandwidth, while the cutoff frequency of the TMTF did not show measurable change. These results are consistent with the predictions of an envelope detector model if peripheral filtering in the lower-frequency range is assumed to be approximately twice as wide as that estimated by measuring thresholds for a tone in notched noise. Restricting the listening region with notched noise increased thresholds for low modulation frequencies but not for high. This is consistent with other data showing that upward spread of excitation may increase the effective modulation depth, but only for low modulation frequencies.",valid

Finally, 40 articles were selected for this systematic review, with a total sample of 1098 patients with GAD. Results suggest that subjects with GAD have a worse performance than controls in the following cognitive domains: complex attention (selective attention), executive functions (working memory, cognitive inhibition, decision making), and social cognition (recognizing and processing emotions, attribution bias). Most consistent results report the influence of emotional stimuli (specifically, threatening or anxiety-provoking stimuli) on performance on cognitive task related with complex attention, working memory and cognitive inhibition. In our knowledge, there is not any previous systematic review defining the neuropsychological profile of GAD. Due to the clinical and functional consequences of cognitive symptoms in these patients, future studies that allow a better knowledge on this field are needed: including larger samples of patients; controlling variables that could eventually modify the association between cognitive symptoms and GAD, such as pharmacological treatment and comorbid depression; focusing on specific neuropsychological test for GAD; and evaluating the effect of pharmacological and psychological treatment on cognitive symptoms in GAD patients.",valid
2976818,"We recently observed the development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in two consecutive newborn infants after gastroschisis repair. Because this association was unexpected, a retrospective review of our 11-year experience was performed using a multivariant computer analysis. The cohort consisted of 54 newborns with gastroschisis. All infants with omphalocele were excluded. Ten of 54 infants (18.5%) developed NEC as defined by classical clinical findings and pneumatosis intestinalis. Twenty-one distinct episodes of NEC occurred with up to three episodes (mean, 2.1) per patient. Twenty of the 21 episodes were successfully treated nonoperatively. Two infants developed pneumoperitoneum, one of whom underwent laparotomy upon which no perforation or intestinal infarction was found. Eight of the ten patients survived--a survival rate no different than for the remainder of the study group. Neither of the two deaths was attributable to NEC. The NEC was atypical in that no significant relationship was established with known predisposing conditions such as prematurity or low Apgar scores. Suspected risk factors such as time of feeding, type of closure, type of formula, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and composition of TPN were not statistically related. Significant associations included concurrent TPN associated cholestatic liver disease in nine of the ten infants, antecedent intestinal surgery other than abdominal wall closure in five of the ten infants, and delay in initiation of enteral feedings (greater than 30 days) in eight of ten infants. In addition, the NEC occurred significantly later (range, 32 to 79 days; mean, 52 days) in the clinical course than usual; in fact, three of ten infants were rehospitalized with NEC following discharge.

However, the limited survival of these patients raises doubts about who really had benefits from it. This study aimed to analyze the surgical outcomes in stage IV GC treated with surgical procedures without curative intent. Retrospective analyses of patients with stage IV GC submitted to surgical procedures including tumor resection, bypass, jejunostomy, and diagnostic laparoscopy were performed. Patients with GC undergoing curative gastrectomy served as the comparison group. Surgical procedures in clinical stage IV were performed in 363 patients. Compared to curative surgery (680 patients), stage IV patients had a higher rate of comorbidities and ASA III/IV classification. The surgical procedures that were performed included 107 (29.4%) bypass procedures (partitioning/gastrojejunal anastomosis), 85 (23.4%) jejunostomies, 76 (20.9%) resections, and 76 (20.9%) diagnostic laparoscopies. Regarding patients' characteristics, resected patients had more distant metastasis (p=0.011), bypass patients were associated with disease in more than one site (p<0.001), and laparoscopy patients had more peritoneal metastasis (p<0.001). According to the type of surgery, the median overall survival was as follows: resection (13.6 months), bypass (7.8 months), jejunostomy (2.7 months), and diagnostic (7.8 months, p<0.001). On multivariate analysis, low albumin levels, in case of more than one site of disease, jejunostomy, and laparoscopy, were associated with worse survival. Stage IV resected cases have better survival, while patients submitted to jejunostomy and diagnostic laparoscopy had the worst results.

870203,"The question of whether mechanical moments participate in ultrastructural development of the heart cannot be decided by examining heart tissue samples during embryonic life, for during maturation processes in vivo mechanical factors are always present. The significance of mechanical moments can only be investigated in a system which allows a distinction to be made between pulsations of heart myocytes under conditions of contraction against and under conditions of contraction without mechanical stress. This double possibility is provided by cell culture. An example in which mechanical influences are absent are the so-called ""minihearts""; these are cell agglomerations which are detached from the culture substrate. Their cell contractions do not act against any mechanical resistance. In the electron microscope they show abundant filaments, Z-line material and membrane specializations. The highest degree of development, however, does not exceed that characterizing the cells with which the cultures were started. Even some dedifferentiation and degeneration are apparent in the minihearts. No intercalated discs can be found even after 12 weeks, provided that the culture had been started with really isolated cells. The representatives in culture of a myocyte's connection with the heart's mechanical action are the cords, along which attached points alternate with free strands. The pulsation of these strands is restrained during each contraction by their ends, which are fixed on the culture substrate. Thus, the myocytes contract against a resistance, and in this respect their pulsations resemble those of the heart, in which the myocytes' contraction acts against the pressure of the blood. The myocyte culture under these mechanical condition, after a culture time of 10 weeks, produces electron micrographs of mature cells with reduced cytoplasm, aligned mitochondria and fibrils and intercalated discs.",valid

To uncover mutations associated with CLL relapse, we have performed whole-exome sequencing in a discovery cohort of 61 relapsed CLL patients identifying 86 recurrently mutated genes. The variant allele fractions (VAF) of 19 genes with mutations in ≥3 of 61 cases were measured in 53 paired pre- and posttreatment CLL samples sorted to purity using panel-based deep resequencing or by droplet digital PCR. We identify mutations in TP53 as the dominant subclonal gene driver of relapsed CLL often demonstrating substantial increases in VAFs. Subclonal mutations in SAMHD1 also recurrently demonstrated increased VAFs at relapse. Mutations in ATP10A, FAT3, FAM50A, and MGA, although infrequent, demonstrated enrichment in ≥2 cases each. In contrast, mutations in NOTCH1, SF3B1, POT1, FBXW7, MYD88, NXF1, XPO1, ZMYM3, or CHD2 were predominantly already clonal prior to therapy indicative of a pretreatment pathogenetic driver role in CLL. Quantitative analyses of clonal dynamics uncover rising, stable, and falling clones and subclones without clear evidence that gene mutations other than in TP53 and possibly SAMHD1 are frequently selected for at CLL relapse. Data in aggregate support a provisional categorization of CLL-associated recurrently mutated genes into three classes (i) often subclonal before therapy and strongly enriched after therapy, or, (ii) mostly clonal before therapy or without further enrichments at relapse, or, (iii) subclonal before and after therapy and enriching only in sporadic cases.

26966332,"The 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone was the worst in history with over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths. Here we examine the psychosocial consequences of the epidemic. Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates. Those affected are likely to experience psychological effects due to the traumatic course of the infection, fear of death and experience of witnessing others dying. Survivors can also experience psychosocial consequences due to feelings of shame or guilt (e.g. from transmitting infection to others) and stigmatization or blame from their communities. At the community level, a cyclical pattern of fear occurs, with a loss of trust in health services and stigma, resulting in disruptions of community interactions and community break down. Health systems in affected countries were severely disrupted and overstretched by the outbreak and their capacities were significantly reduced as almost 900 health-care workers were infected with Ebola and more than 500 died. The outbreak resulted in an increased need for health services, reduced quality of life and economic productivity and social system break down. It is essential that the global response to the outbreak considers both acute and long-term psychosocial needs of individuals and communities. Response efforts should involve communities to address psychosocial need, to rebuild health systems and trust and to limit stigma. The severity of this epidemic and its long-lasting repercussions should spur investment in and development of health systems.",valid

CBF decline is present in AD while the number of affected CNS systems is still quite small. The step-by-step evolution of AD mirrors a brain that progressively becomes ischemic. Areas related to memory function (hippocampus, temporal lobe cortex and vicinity) are bound to suffer first because of their particularly vulnerable blood supply.

Furthermore, heart failure (HR, 1.391; 95% CI, 1.027-1.884), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.615; 95% CI, 1.185-2.202), chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.451; 95% CI, 1.018-2.069), mental disorder (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.106-2.343), end stage renal disease (HR, 5.353; 95% CI, 2.185-13.12) were also associated significantly with mortality. The underlying disease has increased the risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Diabetes, hypertension, cancer, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and mental disorders increased mortality. Controversial whether taking ACEi/ARBs would benefit COVID-19 patients, in our study, patients taking ACEi/ARBs had a higher risk of mortality.",valid
27525864,"We examined the effects of the extract from leaves of Liquidambar formosana Hance on S180 cells and screened for antitumor active sites in the plant. Solvent extraction was conducted to prepare extracts from the leaves of L. formosana Hance and conduct preliminary separation, an MTT assay to determine the effect of leaf extract on the proliferation of S180 cells, and inverted microscopy to observe the effect of chloroform extract on the morphology of S180 cells. Double-staining (Annexin V/propidium iodide) with flow cytometry was conducted to determine the effect of the chloroform extract on S180 cell apoptosis. At some concentrations, the different extracts from the leaves of L. formosana Hance dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of S180 cells. Among all extracts, the chloroform extract showed the strongest inhibitory effect on S180 cell proliferation. The IC50 values for the chloroform extract, ethyl acetate extract, n-butanol extract, and water layer were 0.238, 0.471, 0.844, and 0.411 mg/mL, respectively. We observed cell shrinkage, volume reduction, and varying sizes by inverted microscopy. Additionally, with increasing drug concentration, the number of cells decreased and debris increased. The cells showed typical apoptotic morphological changes. The chloroform extract induced the apoptosis of S180 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Different extracts from the leaves of L. formosana Hance inhibited the proliferation of S180 cells, and the chloroform extract was the main antitumor component. This extract from the leaves of L. formosana Hance inhibited the proliferation of S180 cells in part by inducing apoptosis.",valid

2315710,"Anatomic dissection of 220 cadaver shoulders was performed to find out more about the static stabilizers of the shoulder joint. The static stabilizers, i.e. the glenohumeral ligaments, were always found to be present and strong in healthy shoulders. It was revealed that in anatomic preparations with all the organs removal except the synovial capsule, the capsule ligaments completely stabilized the joint. Anterior dislocation at 45 degrees of abduction was prevented by the superior and medial glenohumeral ligaments, while at 90 degrees of abduction the inferior glenohumeral ligament prevented dislocation. When anterior dislocation has occurred even the coracohumeral ligament must be ruptured. A new finding recorded is that the glenoid labrum is the origin of the inferior glenohumeral ligament and not a triangular static organ enlarging the socket and having a similar function to the menisci in the knee. This ligament is the most important ventral stabilizer of the humeral joint. With the conventional arthrotomy technique the medial and inferior ligaments are immediately cut through and therefore cannot be seen. The inferior glenohumeral ligament must be reconstructed in cases of anterior recurrent dislocation.",valid
19102540,"Ammonia borane, NH(3)BH(3), has attracted significant interest as a promising candidate material for hydrogen storage. The effect of pressure on the bonding in NH(3)BH(3) was investigated using Raman spectroscopy to over 20 GPa in a diamond anvil cell, and two new transitions were observed at approximately 5 and 12 GPa. Vibrational frequencies for the modes of the NH(3) proton donor group exhibited negative pressure dependence, which is consistent with the behavior of conventional hydrogen bonds, while the vibrational frequencies of the BH(3) proton acceptor group showed positive pressure dependence. The observed behavior of these stretching modes supports the presence of dihydrogen bonding at high pressure. In addition, the BH(3) and NH(3) bending modes showed an increase in spectral complexity with increasing pressure together with a discontinuity in d nu/d P which suggests rotational disorder in this molecule. These results may provide guidance for understanding and developing improved hydrogen storage materials.",valid
10821128,"We determined the changes in blood pressure, pulse rate, and heart rate variability during dental surgery in hypertensive patients. The study included 18 essential hypertensives and 18 age and sex matched normotensive controls who underwent tooth extraction at our hospital. Holter electrocardiographic monitoring was used to determine the power spectrum of R-R variability before and during dental surgery. The low frequency (LF: 0.041 to 0.140 Hz), high frequency (HF: 0.140 to 0.500 Hz), and total spectral powers (TF: 0.000 to 4.000 Hz) were calculated, and the ratio of LF to HF and the percentage of HF relative to TF (%HF: HF/TF x 100) were used as indexes of sympathetic and parasympathetic activities, respectively. The baseline blood pressure for hypertensive patients (149 +/- 4/85 +/- 2 mmHg) was significantly higher than that for normotensive patients (119 +/- 3/71 +/- 2 mmHg). The baseline pulse rates were similar between the two groups. Blood pressure increased during tooth extraction in both groups; however, changes in blood pressure did not differ between them. Administration of local anesthetic significantly decreased the %HF in normotensive patients (before vs. after anesthesia; 22.3 +/- 2.4 vs. 13.8 +/- 2.7%, p < 0.05). In contrast, the LF/HF significantly decreased during the local anesthesia and tooth extraction in hypertensive patients. These results suggest that pressor response induced by tooth extraction did not differ between normotensive and hypertensive patients, and that suppression of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system during dental surgery might attenuate the pressor response in patients with hypertension.",valid
27110677,"Increased levels of type I interferon (IFN) and type I IFN-regulated genes are found in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and may be central to its pathogenesis. Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) is a key regulator of type I IFN that undergoes a dramatic prion-like aggregation and self propagates the activation signal from viral RNA to amplify downstream IFN production. We undertook this study to determine whether such MAVS aggregates might play a role in the sustained increased production of type I IFN in SLE. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and mitochondrial extracts were prepared. MAVS aggregation was detected by semidenatured agarose gel electrophoresis and confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. MAVS-associated signaling proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. MAVS aggregation-associated gene expression signature was analyzed by microarray. In blood cells from 22 of 67 SLE patients, essentially all MAVS was in a high molecular weight aggregated form. None of 6 rheumatoid arthritis patients and only 3 of 33 healthy controls had abnormal MAVS. Compared to MAVS aggregate-negative patients, MAVS aggregate-positive SLE patients had significantly higher serum levels of IFNβ and significantly increased levels of autoantibodies against Sm and U1 RNP. Gene array data revealed a characteristic gene expression pattern in these patients, with altered expression of genes involved in IFN signaling and membrane trafficking. Persistent MAVS aggregates may lead to increased type I IFN production and result in unmitigated signals leading to autoimmunity.",valid
23705512,"Conventional wisdom suggests that inhalant use is primarily isolated to youthful experimentation; however, a growing body of evidence suggests that inhalant use (a) occurs after use of common substances of experimentation (e.g., alcohol, marijuana), (b) can persist into later life, and (c) is associated with severe consequences. The current study examined the sequencing of substances relative to inhalants and the post-initiation correlates of inhalant use between youth and young adulthood in nationally representative Add Health data. Analyses examined the relationship of substance of initiation to use of other substances, as well as an examination of the relationship between substance use and consequences. The analyses suggest that (a) those initiating their substance use careers with inhalants often go on to use hard drugs, (b) inhalant use likely occurs after alcohol and marijuana use, and (c) inhalant use during adolescence was associated with health and criminal consequences in both adolescence and young adulthood.",valid
15739453,"A gas chromatographic method for the measurement of enriching characters of adsorbents used in preconcentration of organic compounds from air samples was studied. The character parameters suggested in this study include adsorption parameters (breakthrough volume or maximum sample volume) and desorption ones (minimum flashing volume and the lowest desorption temperature). The parameters of some low-molecular-mass compounds such as alcohols, saturated hydrocarbons, aromatics, esters and halohydrocarbons on GDX-301 were measured by using elution GC method. The maximum sample volumes of all the 20 compounds (with exception of methanol) got from these experiments are not less than 0.8 L at 35 degrees C for sampling tube (filled with 2 g GDX-301) and 0.3 L at 0 degrees C for focus tube (with 0.14 g GDX-301). The corresponding minimum flashing volumes of less than 177 mL and 13 mL respectively are needed to complete desorption at 180 degrees C, and the lowest desorption temperatures of not over 180 degrees C and 157 degrees C at flashing volume of 180 mL and 30 mL are lower than the maximum allowable operating temperature (250 degrees C) of GDX-301. The results showed that GDX-301 is a good adsorbent for enrichment of the organic compounds mentioned above. The following operating conditions are recommended: using the above sampling tube and focus tube, actual sample volume < or = 0.8 L, adsorption temperature < or = 35 degrees C and focus temperature 0 degrees C, desorption for 6 min from sampling tube and 1 min from focus tube at 180 degrees C with flashing rate 30 mL/min. Good correlations between the parameters and boiling point of the investigated compounds were found. It can be used to estimate the parameters of other organic compounds not measured in this study.",valid
8933365,"The influence of plasma corticosterone concentration on serotonin (5-HT) turnover in the dorsal hippocampus was investigated. The experiments were performed in freely moving male Wistar rats in their home cage. Blood samples were taken via a permanent jugular vein catheter to determine plasma corticosterone levels. Extracellular levels of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxy-indole acetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured using in vivo microdialysis. The rats received an intravenous (i.v.) infusion of the steroid synthesis-inhibitor metyrapone (150 mg/kg/ml) in order to manipulate circulating corticosterone levels. Three hours later, the monoamine oxidase inhibitor pargyline (15 mg/kg/2 ml i.v.) was administered to produce an accumulation of extracellular 5-HT. Pargyline administration led to a four fold increase in 5-HT levels, while reducing 5-HIAA by 45%. Metyrapone pretreatment blocked the pargyline-induced rise in plasma corticosterone to baseline levels and diminished the pargyline-induced increase in 5-HT, without affecting 5-HIAA levels. Thus, the data suggest that a decrease in availability of corticosterone for its receptors by metyrapone diminished the 5-HT synthesis rate. Since plasma corticosterone levels during this blockade are still low, it is assumed that brain glucocorticoid receptor occupation is reduced, while mineralocorticoid receptors are still substantially occupied. Therefore the present results support the hypothesis that corticosterone through glucocorticoid receptor activation enhances 5-HT synthesis rate and release in the dorsal hippocampus.",valid
32741045,"Youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) commonly do not meet HbA1c targets. Youth-directed goal setting as a strategy to improve HbA1c has not been well characterized and associations between specific goal focus areas and glycemic control remain unexplored. To inform future trials, this analysis characterized intended focus areas of youth self-directed goals and examined associations with change in HbA1c over a 18 months. We inductively coded counseling session data from youth in the Flexible Lifestyle Empowering Change Intervention (n = 122, 13-16 years, T1D duration >1 year, HbA1c 8-13%) to categorize intended goal focus areas and examine associations between frequency of goal focus areas selected by youth and change in HbA1c between first and last study visit. We identified 13 focus areas that categorized youth goal intentions. Each session where youth goal setting concurrently incorporated blood glucose monitoring (BGM), continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and insulin dosing was associated with a 0.4% (95% CI: -0.77, -0.01; P = .03) lower HbA1c at the end of intervention participation. No association was observed between HbA1c and frequency of sessions where goal intentions focused on BG only (without addressing insulin or CGM) (β: 0.07; 95% CI: -0.07, 0.21; P = .33) nor insulin dosing only (without addressing BGM or CGM) (β: 0.00; 95% CI: -0.11, 0.10; P = .95). Findings exemplify how guiding youth goal development and combining multiple behaviors proximally related to glycemic control into goal setting may benefit HbA1c among youth with T1D. More research characterizing optimal goal setting practices in youth with T1D is needed.",valid
10191766,"Immunophenotypic studies are essential to distinguish acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) from minimally differentiated acute myeloid leukemia (AMLM0) and to classify ALL into immunologic subtypes. Frequently, immunophenotyping identifies myeloid antigen expression in ALL, causing a potential diagnostic problem. To evaluate the immunophenotype of ALL, we studied 210 cases of pediatric and adult ALL by flow cytometry and compared the results with the French-American-British (FAB) Cooperative Group classification and the karyotypic findings. Myeloid-associated antigens were expressed in 78 (45.6%) of precursor B-cell ALL cases. Pediatric precursor B ALLs had a higher frequency of myeloid antigen expression than did adult cases. All mature B-cell ALL cases were negative for TdT and myeloid antigens. Myeloid antigen expression was less frequent in T-cell ALL cases compared with precursor B-cell ALL cases. Of the 192 cases submitted for cytogenetic analysis, 147 were abnormal. The most common chromosomal translocation was the Philadelphia chromosome, which was more likely to have L2 blast morphology and a precursor B immunophenotype. Myeloid antigen expression was present in 70.8% of Ph-positive cases (P = .008). Chromosome rearrangements involving 11q23 also showed an increased frequency of myeloid antigen expression. Chromosome translocations involving regions of T-cell receptor genes were present in 24% of T-cell ALL cases. A high percentage of ALL cases, however, had various other cytogenetic abnormalities, many of which involved less well-studied chromosomal regions.",valid
25731698,"This laboratory study aimed to (a) compare the fluoride dose-response of different caries lesions created in human and bovine enamel (HE/BE) under pH-cycling conditions and (b) investigate the suitability of Knoop and Vickers surface microhardness (K-SMH/V-SMH) in comparison to transverse microradiography (TMR) to investigate lesion de- and remineralization. Caries lesions were formed using three different protocols (Carbopol, hydroxyethylcellulose-HEC, methylcellulose-MeC) and assigned to 24 groups using V-SMH, based on a 2 (enamel types) × 3 (lesion types) × 4 (fluoride concentrations used during pH-cycling-simulating 0/250/1100/2800 ppm F as sodium fluoride dentifrices) factorial design. Changes in mineral content and structural integrity of lesions were determined before and after pH-cycling. Data were analyzed using three-way ANOVA. BE was more prone to demineralization than HE. Both enamel types showed similar responses to fluoride with BE showing more remineralization (as change in integrated mineral loss and lesion depth reduction), although differences between tissues were already present at lesion baseline. Carbopol and MeC lesions responded well to fluoride, whereas HEC lesions were almost inert. K- and V-SMH correlated well with each other and with the integrated mineral loss data, although better correlations were found for HE than for BE and for MeC than for Carbopol lesions. Hardness data for HEC lesions correlated only with surface zone mineral density data. BE is a suitable surrogate for HE under pH-cycling conditions. The in vitro modeling of dental caries is complex and requires knowledge of lesion behavior, analytical techniques, and employed hard tissues.",valid

To report the case of a patient with a black esophagus revealed by an upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. A 72-year-old patient with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and ischemic heart disease was hospitalized in surgical intensive care unit for hemorrhagic shock induced by cholecystectomy. On the 7th postoperative day, the patient developed acute hematemesis. Gastroscopy showed circumferential necrosis, localized in the middle and lower third of the esophagus and stopped abruptly at the gastroesophageal junction. Gastric mucosa was strictly normal. The bulb and the first part of duodenum showed multiple superficial ulcers without signs of recent hemorrhage. The patient was placed on absolute diet and total parenteral nutrition associated with high-dose intravenous proton pump inhibitor. Second-look gastroscopy, performed six days later, showed a significant improvement in esophageal lesions. The evolution was marked by the occurrence of pneumonia complicated by septic shock which caused patient's death. Black esophagus is a rare pathology of multifactorial etiology. Treatment is based on proton pump inhibitors in combination with resuscitation measures to control comorbidities.

35704637,"Mutation-induced protein misfolding of pancreatic secretory enzymes and consequent endoplasmic reticulum stress can cause chronic pancreatitis. A recent study revealed that cigarette smoke also increases the risk of the disease through endoplasmic reticulum stress. Here, we investigated the cumulative cellular effect of the G233E misfolding human pancreatic lipase variant and hydroquinone; a main toxic constituent of cigarette smoke, using mammalian cell lines. We found that hydroquinone reduces cell viability on a dose-dependent manner through programmed cell death, and diminishes lipase secretion without affecting its expression. Interestingly, hydroquinone decreased the viability more markedly in cells expressing the G233E lipase variant, than in cells producing wild-type lipase. The more substantial viability loss was due to increased endoplasmic reticulum stress, as demonstrated by elevated levels of X-box binding protein 1 mRNA splicing and immunoglobulin binding protein, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 and C/EBP homologous protein expression. Unresolved endoplasmic reticulum stress, and especially up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein were likely responsible for the increased cell death. Our observations demonstrated that the combination of hydroquinone and misfolding pancreatic lipase variant promote increased levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell death, which may predispose to chronic pancreatitis.",valid

27320114,"Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a major oncological emergency. TLS is common in patients with hematological malignancies, but it can occur across a spectrum of cancer types. Germ cell tumors (GCT) have rapid cancer cell turnover and often present with bulky metastasis. The international TLS expert consensus panel has recommended guidelines for a medical decision tree to assign low, intermediate and high risk to patients with cancer at risk for TLS. GCT is classified as intermediate risk for TLS, and the patients who have other TLS risks factors are classified to be at high risk for TLS. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 67 patients with metastatic GCT who were treated with induction chemotherapy at Tsukuba University Hospital between 2000 and 2013. Thirty-one, 15 and 21 patients were classified with good-, intermediate- and poor-prognosis disease, respectively, according to the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group criteria. Twelve patients (18%) were classified to be at high risk for TLS, and two patients were treated with allopurinol or rasburicase as prophylaxes for TLS. They did not show progression to laboratory TLS (L-TLS). In the remaining 10 TLS high-risk patients, three (30%) patients developed L-TLS after chemotherapy and started receiving oral allopurinol. As a result, no patients developed clinical TLS (C-TLS). In this study, 30% of TLS-high risk patients developed L-TLS without prophylactic treatment. Therefore, it is important to conduct TLS-risk stratification and consider prophylaxis such as rasburicase for advanced GCT patients at induction chemotherapy.",valid

In fatty tissues, 787 results exceeded the limits of quantification (LOQ): 16 OCPs, eight OPPs, six pyrethroids, one carbamate, and seven PCBs. The most positive results in fat samples were found for OCPs, with a frequency of quantification in the range of 57.5-87.5%. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) were quantified in the highest percentages, in the ranges of 5.5-66.7% and 5.4-55.8%.

Bereaved family caregivers report insomnia symptoms that persist beyond 1 year, longer than what is seen in bereaved noncaregivers, placing them at increased risk of depression and complicated grief. Despite some rewarding elements, caregiving is a stressful and exhausting role that often requires the caregiver to restructure his or her life around the needs of the patient. Once the patient dies, the structure is lost. Cognitive behavioral therapy interventions are effective in providing structure.

27746639,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, complex disease that follows a chronic relapsing course and significantly affects the quality of life of patients. Skin barrier dysfunction and inflammatory processes induce and aggravate this skin condition. Proper use of an emollient for hydration is a keystone of AD treatment. Bee venom is known to have anti-inflammatory effects and has been widely used in traditional medicine to treat various inflammatory disorders. To find out the beneficial effect of an emollient containing bee venom in the treatment of patients with AD. This study included 136 patients with AD who were randomized to receive either an emollient containing bee venom and silk-protein or a vehicle that was identical except for the bee venom for 4 weeks. The patients were instructed to apply the emollient twice daily on their entire body and not to use other medications, including topicals, during the course of the study. The eczema area and severity index (EASI) score, transepidermal water loss, and visual analogue scale (VAS) score of itching were evaluated at the first visit and after 2 and 4 weeks. The investigator global assessment was evaluated at 2 and 4 weeks after the application of emollient containing bee venom or vehicle. Patients applying emollient containing bee venom showed significantly lower EASI score and VAS value compared to patients applying emollient without bee venom. Emollient containing bee venom is a safe and effective option for patients with AD.",valid
31054332,"It is well known that performance on a trial is flexibly modulated by preceding trial congruency in tasks that require cognitive control, such as the Stroop task, referred to as the conflict adaptation effect (CAE). The CAE indicates that conflict on the preceding trial leads to enhanced cognitive control, leading to more efficient regulation of current conflict. The present study aimed to identify neural mechanisms implicated in individual differences in CAEs. The participants performed a version of the color-word Stroop task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment and were divided into two groups according to the magnitude of behavioral CAE: one exhibiting the CAE only in congruent trials and the other in both congruent and incongruent trials. The imaging results showed different activations in the pre-supplementary motor area for the Stroop effect between groups. Importantly, group differences in activation for the preceding trials were observed in several prefrontal regions including the bilateral frontopolar, dorsolateral prefrontal, and rostro-dorsal cingulate cortices. More interestingly, analyses of the preceding trials suggest that the frontopolar cortex is involved in conflict resolution through higher-order cognitive control strategies that are closely associated with subsequent conflict. The current study provides new evidence of the role of the frontopolar cortex in conflict adaptation.",valid
11372996,"Two species of necrophagous Coleoptera: Dermestes frischi (Dermestidae) and Thanatophilus sinuatus (Silphidae), were reared on substrates containing different amounts of morphine. Colonies of D. frischi were reared on rabbit carcasses which had been given 10, 20, and 40 mg/h of morphine hydrochloride via ear artery perfusion over a 3 h period prior to death. A fourth rabbit served as a control. T. sinuatus was reared on minced beef spiked with morphine hydrochloride to give concentrations of 1,000, 2,500, 5,000, and 10,000 ng/g and one control colony. These dosages were calculated to create tissue concentrations of morphine similar to those encountered in human deaths due to morphine overdose. Larvae. pupae, and adults (except for T. sinuatus) were analyzed for morphine content. All developmental stages of D. frischi were positive for morphine and concentrations correlated with cadaveric tissue concentrations during larval stages and to a lesser extent in the adult stage. For T. sinuatus, the best correlations were found in 2nd and 3rd instar larvae. This study demonstrates the potential for use of necrophagous Coleoptera, as well as Diptera larvae, as alternate specimens for toxicological analyses.",valid
36944677,"Antibiotic stewardship is viewed as having great public health benefit with limited direct benefit to the patient at the time of administration. The objective of our study was to determine if inappropriate administration of antibiotics could create conditions that would increase the rates of surgical infection. We hypothesized that sub-MIC levels of vancomycin would increase Staphylococcus aureus growth, biofilm formation, and rates of infection. S. aureus MRSA and MSSA strains were used for all experiments. Bacteria were grown planktonically and monitored using spectrophotometry. Quantitative agar culture was used to measure planktonic and biofilm bacterial burden. A mouse abscess model was used to confirm phenotypes in vivo. In the planktonic growth assay, increases in bacterial burden at ¼ MIC vancomycin were observed in USA300 JE2 by 72 h. Similar findings were observed with ½ MIC in Newman and SH1000. For biofilm formation, USA300 JE2 at ¼ and ½ MIC vancomycin increased biofilm formation by approximately 1.3- and 2.3-fold respectively at 72 h as compared to untreated controls. Similar findings were observed with Newman and SH1000 with a 2.4-fold increase in biofilm formation at ½ MIC vancomycin. In a mouse abscess model, there was a 1.2-fold increase with sub-MIC vancomycin at 3 days post infection. Our study showed that Sub-optimal vancomycin dosing promoted S. aureus planktonic growth and biofilm formation, phenotypic measures of bacterial virulence. This phenotype induced by sub-MIC levels of vancomycin was also observed to increase rates of infection and pathogenesis in our mouse model. Risks of exposure to sub-MIC concentrations with vancomycin in surgical procedures are greater as there is decreased bioavailability in tissue in comparison to other antibiotics. This highlights the importance of proper antibiotic selection, stewardship, and dosing for both surgical prophylaxis and treatment of infection.",valid
7873566,"The cathodic reduction at the mercury electrode of a biliverdin IX alpha-serum albumin complex at physiological pH in an aqueous buffer containing percentages of DMSO ranging from 4% to 20% is studied by cyclic voltametry and controlled potential coulometry. The progression of pigment disappearance and the (stereochemical) nature of the product are monitored by chromatography, UV-visible absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Upon reduction, albumin-bound biliverdin IX alpha, with a slight preference for the P-helicity, affords the corresponding bound bilirubin IX alpha -with an M-chirality conformation. The complex is reduced at -0.64 V (vs. SCE; 8% DMSO), only a little shifted compared to reduction of free biliverdin IX alpha under the same conditions. In contrast, an analogous bilirubin IX alpha-serum albumin complex is essentially inert towards cathodic reduction under conditions where free bilirubin IX alpha is reduced, indicating a better shielding by the protein of the bilirubin IX alpha molecule from the electrode surface. The presence of relative position (as in the biliverdins IX alpha and XIII alpha) or absence (as in mesobiliverdin IX alpha) of vinyl groups in the pigment does not have a significant effect upon its electroreduction behaviour, indicating that the process is not sensitive to the subtle differences imposed by vinyl groups upon the structure of the corresponding biliverdin-albumin complexes.",valid
33504732,"More complex aneurysms can be treated by coil embolization with neck-bridge stent assistance. However, concerns about postprocedural ischemic or hemorrhagic complications remain. In this study, we assessed the long-term durability after introduction of neck-bridge stent in the context of coil embolization for unruptured aneurysm by comparing re-treatment and neurological events between the pre-stent and stent eras. Unruptured aneurysms treated by coil embolization between April 2005 and May 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. We divided cases into two groups: the pre-stent era and the stent era. The cumulative rate of re-treatment and neurological events were assessed and compared. During the period, 177 aneurysms were treated in the pre-stent era and 354 aneurysms were treated in the stent era. The median follow-up was 55 months. In the stent era, the dome/neck (D/N) ratio was significantly lower (P <0.001) and the number of aneurysms located at the posterior circulation was higher (P <0.001). A stent was used in 31.92% of cases in the stent era. The cumulative rate of re-treatment was significantly higher in the pre-stent era than it was in the stent era in univariate and multivariate analyses (P = 0.008, P = 0.008, respectively). The cumulative rate of neurological events was not significantly different between the two groups. The re-treatment rate has been improved without increasing neurological complications after introduction of the neck-bridge stent.",valid
21083191,"Digoxin is an important therapeutic agent for the treatment of congestive cardiac failure. In spite of its narrow therapeutic index, digoxin has been used extensively by the medical community and, lately, the use of digoxin as a mechanistic probe for p-glycoprotein transporter activity has increased. This review describes recent trends in the bioanalysis of digoxin, where scores of liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric assays have been successfully employed to measure digoxin in preclinical, clinical and mechanistic studies. It provides various considerations such as internal standard selection, extraction schemes, matrix effect, selectivity evaluation and optimization of mass spectral conditions, for example, to enable the development of sound bioanalytical methods for digoxin. Some recent updates with regard to clinical pharmacology, absorption and disposition aspects of digoxin have been included. Overall, liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric assays represent an important tool for many future preclinical, clinical and mechanistic probe studies that would probe digoxin with or without other coadministered substrates.",valid

They were assessed for their metal uptake potential. The fly ash was slightly alkaline with very less nitrogen and organic carbon but enriched with phosphorus and heavy metals. Lantana camara and Ipomoea carnea showed good translocation from root to shoot for most of the metals except Mn and Pb. The order of metal accumulation in stem of both the plants were Fe(205mg/kg)>Mn(65mg/kg)>Cu(22.35mg/kg)>Pb(6.6mg/kg)>Cr(3.05mg/kg)>Ni(1 mg/kg)>Cd(0.5 mg/kg) and Fe(741 mg/kg)>Mn(154.05 mg/kg)>Cu(20.75 mg/kg)>Pb(6.75 mg/kg)>Ni(4.0 mg/kg)>Cr(3.3mg/kg)>Cd(0.05mg/kg), respectively. But Solanum surattense accumulated most of the metals in roots. The order was in the following order, Mn (382.2mg/kg) >Fe (264.1mg/kg) > Cu (25.35mg/kg) >Pb (5.95 mg/kg) > Ni (1.9 mg/kg) > Cr (1.8mg/kg) > Cd (0.55 mg/kg). The order of Bioconcentration factor (BCF) in root and shoot followed almost the same order as, Mn>Fe>Ni>Pb>Cu>Cr≈ Cd in all the three species. ANOVA showed significant variation in metal accumulation by root and stem between the species. Finally, it can be concluded that Solanum surattense can be used as phytostabilizer and other two species as phytoextractor of metal for fly ash dumpsite reclamation.",valid

It is demonstrated in an asymptotic analysis that in the case of an arbitrary value of the solid diffusivity, five types of constraints exist between interpolating functions used in the phase-field model, which need to be satisfied simultaneously to eliminate all anomalous interface effects. Then, the authors present an appropriate form of the antitrapping current term for the two-sided case to remove all the spurious effects. The convergence test of the output with respect to the interface thickness was carried out for the isothermal dendrite growth process, which demonstrates an excellent performance of the present model.",valid
20965888,"In developed countries, coronary artery disease (CAD) continues to be a major cause of death and disability. Over the past two decades, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has become more widely accessible for the management of ischemic heart disease. Positron emission tomography has also emerged as an important alternative perfusion imaging modality in the context of recent shortages of molybdenum-99/technetium-99m ((99m)Tc). The clinical application of PET in ischaemic heart disease falls into two main categories: first, it is a well-established modality for evaluation of myocardial blood flow (MBF); second, it enables assessment of myocardial metabolism and viability in patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction. The combined study of MBF and metabolism by PET has led to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of ischaemic heart disease. While there are potential future applications of PET for plaque and molecular imaging, as well as some clinical use in inflammatory conditions, this article provides an overview of the physical and biological principles behind PET imaging and its main clinical applications in cardiology, namely the assessment of MBF and metabolism.",valid
21053054,"Previous studies noted specific changes in urinary porphyrin excretion patterns associated with exposure to mercury (Hg) in animals and humans. In our study, urinary porphyrin concentrations were examined in normal children 8-18 years-old from a reanalysis of data provided from a randomized, prospective clinical trial that was designed to evaluate the potential health consequences of prolonged exposure to Hg from dental amalgam fillings (the parent study). Our analysis examined dose-dependent correlations between increasing Hg exposure from dental amalgams and urinary porphyrins utilizing statistical models with adjustments for the baseline level (i.e. study year 1) of the following variables: urinary Hg, each urinary porphyrin measure, gender, race, and the level of lead (Pb) in each subject's blood. Significant dose-dependent correlations between cumulative exposure to Hg from dental amalgams and urinary porphyrins associated with Hg body-burden (pentacarboxyporphyrin, precoproporphyrin, and coproporphyrin) were observed. Overall, 5-10% increases in Hg-associated porphyrins for subjects receiving an average number of dental amalgam fillings in comparison to subjects receiving only composite fillings were observed over the 8-year course of the study. In contrast, no significant correlations were observed between cumulative exposure to Hg from dental amalgams and urinary porphyrins not associated with Hg body-burden (uroporphyrin, heptacarboxyporphyrin, and hexacarboxyporphyrin). In conclusion, our study, in contrast to the no-effect results published from the parent study, further establishes the sensitivity and specificity of specific urinary porphyrins as a biomarker for low-level Hg body-burden, and also reveals that dental amalgams are a significant chronic contributor to Hg body-burden.",valid
2844953,"Serum incubated with purified EBV was found to contain C3 cleavage fragments characteristic of C3c. Since the cofactors necessary for such cleavage of C3b by factor I are not normally present in serum, EBV was tested for factor I cofactor activity. Purified EBV from both human and marmoset EBV-producing cell lines was found to act as a cofactor for the factor I-mediated breakdown C3b to iC3b and iC3b to C3c and C3dg. EBV also acted as a cofactor for the factor I-mediated cleavage of C4b to iC4b and iC4b to C4c and C4d. EBV from both the human and marmoset cell lines accelerated the decay of the alternative pathway C3 convertase. The classical pathway C3 convertase was unaffected. Multiple lines of evidence eliminated the possibility that marmoset or human CR1 was responsible for the functional activities of EBV preparations. The spectrum of activities was different from CR1 in that EBV and EBV-expressing cell lines failed to rosette with C3b or particles bearing C3b, the primary functional assay for CR1, and EBV did not accelerate classical pathway C3 convertase decay, another property of CR1. In addition, CR1 could not be detected immunologically on marmoset or human EBV-expressing cells and mAbs to CR1 failed to alter EBV-produced decay acceleration and factor I cofactor activities, although the antibodies blocked the same CR1-dependent functional activities. The multiple complement regulatory activities exhibited by purified EBV derived from human and marmoset cells differ from those of any of the known C3 or C4 regulatory proteins. These various activities would be anticipated to provide survival value for the virus by subverting complement- and cell-dependent host defense mechanisms.",valid

To compare the relative effects of single, double or multiple injections for axillary block of the brachial plexus for distal upper limb surgery. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE and reference lists of trials. We contacted trial authors. The date of the last search was March 2011 (updated from March 2005). We included randomized controlled trials that compared double with single-injection techniques, multiple with single-injection techniques, or multiple with double-injection techniques for axillary block in adults undergoing surgery of the distal upper limb. We excluded trials using ultrasound-guided techniques. We performed independent study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. We undertook meta-analysis. The 20 included trials involved a total of 2098 participants who received regional anaesthesia for hand, wrist, forearm or elbow surgery. The trial design and conduct were generally adequate although several trials failed to monitor longer-term effects.Eight trials comparing double versus single injections showed a statistically significant decrease in primary anaesthesia failure (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.85). Subgroup analysis by method of nerve location showed that the effect size was greater when neurostimulation was used rather than the transarterial technique.Seven trials comparing multiple with single injections showed a statistically significant decrease in primary anaesthesia failure (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.48) and of incomplete motor block (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.96) in the multiple injection group.Eleven trials comparing multiple with double injections showed a statistically significant decrease in primary anaesthesia failure (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.40) and of incomplete motor block (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.85) in the multiple injection group.Tourniquet pain was significantly reduced with multiple injections compared with double injections (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.84). Otherwise, there were no statistically significant differences between groups in any of the three comparisons on secondary analgesia failure, complications and patient discomfort. The time for block performance was significantly shorter for single and double injections compared with multiple injections. This review provides evidence that multiple injection techniques using nerve stimulation for axillary plexus block produce more effective anaesthesia than either double or single injection techniques. However, there was insufficient evidence for a significant difference in other outcomes, including safety.",valid

36694093,"To evaluate the impact of an optimal and reproducible cutoff value set according to a predefined lymphopenia scale as an early predictor of in-hospital mortality and other outcomes in patients hospitalized with pneumococcal pneumonia and positive urinary antigen at admission to the emergency department. An observational cohort study was conducted based on analysis of a prospective registry of consecutive immunocompetent adults hospitalized for pneumococcal pneumonia in two tertiary hospitals. Generalized additive models were constructed to assess the smooth relationship between in-hospital mortality and lymphopenia. We included 1173 patients. Lymphopenia on admission was documented in 686 (58.4%). No significant differences were observed between groups regarding the presence of comorbidities. Overall, 299 (25.5%) patients were admitted to intensive care and 90 (7.6%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Fifty-nine (5%) patients died, among them 23 (38.9%) in the first 72 h after admission. A lymphocyte count < 500/μL, documented in 282 (24%) patients, was the predefined cutoff point that best predicted in-hospital mortality. After adjustment, these patients had higher rates of intensive care admission (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.9-4.3), invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.2-3.9), septic shock (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.1-2.9), treatment failure (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2-3.5), and in-hospital mortality (OR 2.2; 95% 1.1-4.9). Severe lymphopenia outperformed PSI score in predicting early and 30-day mortality in patients classified in the higher-risk classes. Lymphocyte count < 500/μL could be used as a reproducible predictor of complicated clinical course in patients with an early diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia.",valid
1593194,"Lateral elbow pain syndrome is probably a fairly common condition and known to be resistant to conservative treatments. It is suggested that this syndrome is caused by entrapment of the radial nerve. Thirty patients with lateral elbow pain syndrome, in which entrapment of the radial nerve was diagnosed, have been operated upon to release the radial nerve at the elbow. There were 9 men and 21 women. Their age ranged from 17 to 64 with an average of 42.5. Twenty one of thirty nerves were entraped by the arcade of Frohse or other soft tissues. Nine nerves were adherent to the tissues overlying the radial head. Follow-up has been from six months to two years and eight months. Postoperative results were excellent in 16 patients, good in 11, fair in two and poor in one. These results would indicate that entrapment of the radial nerve at the elbow is considered as a cause of lateral elbow pain syndrome.",valid

Larvae hatched on agarose gel substrates and crawled onto the surface of moist agarose gels, but they tended only to burst the egg cap and remain within the egg case on drier gels. A mixture of cultured bacteria, originating from a natural larval habitat of An. gambaiae s.s. in western Kenya, was classified by 16S rDNA sequence analysis, and then this mixture or individual colonies from it was used as odor sources in ovipositional experiments with agarose substrates. Of 61 sequences from a mixed clone sequence library, most (78%) were Pseudomonas strains, whereas the remainder were Stenotrophomonas, Enterobacter, Pantoea, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, and Bacillus. Oviposition was significantly reduced when mixtures of bacterial colonies of these strains, or a lawn of colonies of a field isolate of S. maltophilia, was presented. Oviposition was neither reduced nor enhanced when field isolates of Pseudomonas putida or Pseudomonas alcaligenes colonies were presented. These results suggest that gravid An. gambiae females are sensitive to bacterial-derived odors emanating from cultured bacteria from natural larval habitats and that some bacterial odors may be repellent.",valid

A cross-sectional study was undertaken in an NHS hospital in Greece to assess the theoretical knowledge of nurses and assistant nurses in relation to CPR. The study population surveyed consisted of nurses and assistant nurses of a specific public hospital. The study revealed that nursing staff had poor theoretical knowledge, with a mean score for correct answers in the written test of 50.6 ± 25.9% and a mean 4.1 ± 2 correct answers.
