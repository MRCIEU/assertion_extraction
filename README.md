# Assertion Extraction from Biomedical Abstracts

This repository contains all code, configuration, and modules for an experimental pipeline to extract scientific assertions (subject–predicate–object triples) from biomedical literature. The core focus is on evaluating and comparing different LLMs for multi-stage information extraction.

---

## Project Overview

The pipeline is divided into three main stages:

1. **Finding Detection** – Identify which sentences in an abstract contain scientific findings.
2. **Completion and Resolution** – Convert finding sentences into standalone factual statements.
3. **Assertion Extraction** – Convert standalone statements into structured triples: (subject, predicate, object), with optional conditions.

## Current Main Experiment: `05_three_single_pipeline/`

This folder includes the three sequential LLM pipelines:

- `finding_pipeline.py` – Run GPT/Claude/LLaMA to identify finding sentences.
- `completion_pipeline.py` – Expand sentences into standalone factual units.
- `assertion_pipeline.py` – Extract subject–predicate–object triples.

Additional utilities:
- `schemas.py`, `json_utils.py`, `prompts.py` – shared dataclass schemas, JSON parsing, and prompt templates.
- `config.py` – API keys and model configuration (use environment variables in production).

- `eval/` – evaluation outputs and summary statistics.
