8057077,"Inward rectifier (IR) K+ channels of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells were studied using the whole-cell, cell-attached, and outside-out patch-clamp configurations. The effects of Rb+ on the voltage dependence and kinetics of IR gating were explored, with [Rb+]o + [K+]o = 160 mM. Partial substitution of Rb+ for K+ resulted in voltage-dependent reduction of inward currents, consistent with Rb+ being a weakly permeant blocker of the IR. In cells studied with a K(+)-free pipette solution, external Rb+ reduced inward IR currents to a similar extent at large negative potentials but block at more positive potentials was enhanced. In outside-out patches, the single-channel i-V relationship was approximately linear in symmetrical K+, but rectified strongly outwardly in high [Rb+]o due to a reduced conductance for inward current. The permeability of Rb+ based on reversal potential, Vrev, was 0.45 that of K+, whereas the Rb+ conductance was much lower, 0.034 that of K+, measured at Vrev-80 mV. The steady state voltage-dependence of IR gating was determined in Rb(+)-containing solutions by applying variable prepulses, followed by a test pulse to a potential at which outward current deactivation was observed. As [Rb+]o was increased, the half-activation potential, V1/2, changed less than Vrev. In high [K+]o solutions V1/2 was Vrev-6 mV, while in high [Rb+]o V1/2 was Vrev + 7 mV. This behavior contrasts with the classical parallel shift of V1/2 with Vrev in K+ solutions. Steady state IR gating was less steeply voltage-dependent in high [Rb+]o than in K+ solutions, with Boltzmann slope factors of 6.4 and 4.4 mV, respectively. Rb+ decreased (slowed) both activation and deactivation rate constants defined at V1/2, and decreased the steepness of the voltage dependence of the activation rate constant by 42%. Deactivation of IR channels in outside-out patches was also slowed by Rb+. In summary, Rb+ can replace K+ in setting the voltage-dependence of IR gating, but in doing so alters the kinetics.",valid,2216865

32272430,"Object recognition is a primary function of the human visual system. It has recently been claimed that the highly successful ability to recognise objects in a set of emergent computer vision systems-Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs)-can form a useful guide to recognition in humans. To test this assertion, we systematically evaluated visual crowding, a dramatic breakdown of recognition in clutter, in DCNNs and compared their performance to extant research in humans. We examined crowding in three architectures of DCNNs with the same methodology as that used among humans. We manipulated multiple stimulus factors including inter-letter spacing, letter colour, size, and flanker location to assess the extent and shape of crowding in DCNNs. We found that crowding followed a predictable pattern across architectures that was different from that in humans. Some characteristic hallmarks of human crowding, such as invariance to size, the effect of target-flanker similarity, and confusions between target and flanker identities, were completely missing, minimised or even reversed. These data show that DCNNs, while proficient in object recognition, likely achieve this competence through a set of mechanisms that are distinct from those in humans. They are not necessarily equivalent models of human or primate object recognition and caution must be exercised when inferring mechanisms derived from their operation.",valid,

37150779,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the field of medical imaging and has the potential to bring medicine from the era of 'sick-care' to the era of healthcare and prevention. The development of AI requires access to large, complete, and harmonized real-world datasets, representative of the population, and disease diversity. However, to date, efforts are fragmented, based on single-institution, size-limited, and annotation-limited datasets. Available public datasets (e.g., The Cancer Imaging Archive, TCIA, USA) are limited in scope, making model generalizability really difficult. In this direction, five European Union projects are currently working on the development of big data infrastructures that will enable European, ethically and General Data Protection Regulation-compliant, quality-controlled, cancer-related, medical imaging platforms, in which both large-scale data and AI algorithms will coexist. The vision is to create sustainable AI cloud-based platforms for the development, implementation, verification, and validation of trustable, usable, and reliable AI models for addressing specific unmet needs regarding cancer care provision. In this paper, we present an overview of the development efforts highlighting challenges and approaches selected providing valuable feedback to future attempts in the area.Key points• Artificial intelligence models for health imaging require access to large amounts of harmonized imaging data and metadata.• Main infrastructures adopted either collect centrally anonymized data or enable access to pseudonymized distributed data.• Developing a common data model for storing all relevant information is a challenge.• Trust of data providers in data sharing initiatives is essential.• An online European Union meta-tool-repository is a necessity minimizing effort duplication for the various projects in the area.",valid,10164664

31030749,"Heparin is an anticoagulant medication that was discovered in 1917 and used in clinic since 1935. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) represent a refined use of heparin as anticoagulant medications that were developed in 1980s. LMWHs are obtained by cleaving heparin with different chemical or enzymatic methods. Eight chemically distinct and officially approved LMWHs are Bemiparin, Certoparin, Dalteparin, Enoxaparin, Nadroparin, Parnaparin, Reviparin, and Tinzaparin. LMWHs are mainly used for preventing blood clots, for treating deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and for treating myocardial infarction. LMWHs have advantages over heparin in that they can be used at home with good predictability, dose-dependent plasma levels, a long half-life, less bleeding for a given antithrombotic even, smaller risk of osteoporosis in long-term use, and smaller risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, a potential side effect of heparin. However, heparin is reversible with protamine sulfate while LMWHs have no antidote. Moreover, LMWHs have less of an effect on inhibiting thrombin activity than heparin. Furthermore, patients with end-stage renal diseases have to use heparin because LMWHs are dependent on functioning kidney for their clearance but heparin is primarily cleared in the liver. We will review the recent progress made on the clinically approved and under clinical trialed LMWHs and their potential medical applications. In particular, we will provide an update on the chemical characteristics and clinical use of different branded LMWHs. In addition, the potential clinical applications of LMWHs in other therapeutic area will also be discussed.",valid,

However, it was not known whether or not continuous use of the anchor system would improve postural control after its removal. Additionally, it was unclear as to whether or not frequency of use of the anchor system is related to improved control in older adults. The present study evaluated the effect of the prolonged use of the anchor system on postural control in healthy older individuals, at different frequencies of use, while they performed a postural control task (semi-tandem position). Participants were divided into three groups according to the frequency of the anchor system's use (0%, 50%, and 100%). Pre-practice phase (without anchor) was followed by a practice phase (they used the anchor system at the predefined frequency), and a post-practice phase (immediate and late-without anchor). All three groups showed a persistent effect 15min after the end of the practice phase (immediate post-practice phase). However, only the 50% group showed a persistent effect in the late post-practice phase (24h after finishing the practice phase). Older adults can improve their postural control by practicing the standing postural task, and use of the anchor system limited to half of their practice time can provide additional improvement in their postural control.",valid,

7049964,"Tc99m labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Tc-99m-DTPA) is an appropriate in vivo test solute for all extracorporeal detoxification procedures. The molecular weight of the Tc-99m-DTPA complex is within the biologically relevant middle molecular range of 400 to 700 daltons. Tc-99m-DTPA is distributed in the extracellular space in the same way as inulin. Regarding its localization in the gel filtration spectra and plasma clearance, Tc-99m-DTPA corresponds to middle molecule peak 2. The evaluation of elimination rate and plasma clearance CP of Tc-99m-DTPA is possible by measuring the pulse rates before and after the detoxification device. Taking into account the corrections for Ht and UFR, the Tc-99m-DTPA plasma clearances were calculated for different dialyzers, high flux dialyzers, hemofilters and a hemoperfusion device. The continuous measurement of pulse rates and the use of a UFR-controller (A2008) allow an exact tracking of CP vs. time, the estimation of CP (QB), CP(UFR) and of the sieving coefficient. Examples are given for these cases. It was shown that an increase in plasma clearance to more than about 100 ml/min does not greatly increase the Tc-99m-DTPA elimination rate.",valid,
30126148,"Hyperspectral sensors, especially the close-range hyperspectral camera, have been widely introduced to detect biological processes of plants in the high-throughput phenotyping platform, to support the identification of biotic and abiotic stress reactions at an early stage. However, the complex geometry of plants and their interaction with the illumination, severely affects the spectral information obtained. Furthermore, plant structure, leaf area, and leaf inclination distribution are critical indexes which have been widely used in multiple plant models. Therefore, the process of combination between hyperspectral images and 3D point clouds is a promising approach to solve these problems and improve the high-throughput phenotyping technique. We proposed a novel approach fusing a low-cost depth sensor and a close-range hyperspectral camera, which extended hyperspectral camera ability with 3D information as a potential tool for high-throughput phenotyping. An exemplary new calibration and analysis method was shown in soybean leaf experiments. The results showed that a 0.99 pixel resolution for the hyperspectral camera and a 3.3 millimeter accuracy for the depth sensor, could be achieved in a controlled environment using the method proposed in this paper. We also discussed the new capabilities gained using this new method, to quantify and model the effects of plant geometry and sensor configuration. The possibility of 3D reflectance models can be used to minimize the geometry-related effects in hyperspectral images, and to significantly improve high-throughput phenotyping. Overall results of this research, indicated that the proposed method provided more accurate spatial and spectral plant information, which helped to enhance the precision of biological processes in high-throughput phenotyping.",valid,6111299

The patients were matched for age, body mass index, primary renal disease and dose of prednisolone, but not for the duration in transplantation and serum creatinine concentration. Triglyceride concentrations were significantly higher in the CsA/P group than in Aza/P-treated patients: 2.62 +/- 0.35 vs 1.62 +/- 0.23 mmol/l (P less than 0.05). Similarly, total cholesterol (C) levels were significantly more elevated in the CsA/P recipients than in the other group: 7.44 +/- 0.32 vs 5.84 +/- 0.25 (P less than 0.02). CsA/P patients had higher serum levels of LDL-C (4.79 +/- 0.20 vs 3.43 +/- 0.19 mmol/l (P less than 0.001) and apolipoprotein B concentrations (191 +/- 13 vs 128 +/- 9 mg/dl: P less than 0.001). CsA/P and Aza/P recipients had similar concentrations of HDL-C (1.73 +/- 0.13 vs 1.52 +/- 0.09 mmol/l: NS).

Oscillatory and steady flow measurements of Dictyostelium wild-type cells in a torsion pendulum showed that there is a large elastic component to the viscoelasticity of the cell pellet. Quantitative rheological measurements were performed with an electronic plate-and-cone rheometer, which allowed determination of G', the storage shear modulus, and G"", the viscous loss modulus, as a function of time, frequency, and strain, respectively. Whole cell viscoelasticity depends strongly on all three parameters, and comparison of wild-type and mutant strains under identical conditions generally produced significant differences. Especially stress relaxation experiments consistently revealed a clear difference between cells that lacked alpha-actinin as compared with wild-type cells or transformants without ABP120 gelation factor, indicating that alpha-actinin plays an important role in cell elasticity. Direct observation of cells undergoing shear deformation was done by incorporating a small number of AX2 cells expressing the green fluorescent protein of Aequorea victoria and visualizing the strained cell pellet by fluorescence and phase contrast microscopy. These observations confirmed that the shear strain imposed by the rheometer does not injure the cells and that the viscoelastic response of the cell pellet is due to deformation of individual cells.",valid,1225007

27008086,"Amphotericin B (AMB) is a highly hydrophobic antifungal, whose use is limited by its toxicity and poor solubility. To improve its solubility, AMB was reacted with a functionalized polyethylene glycol (PEG), yielding soluble complex AmB-PEG formulations that theoretically comprise of chemically conjugated AMB-PEG and free AMB that is physically associated with the conjugate. Reverse-phase chromatography and size exclusion chromatography methods using HPLC were developed to separate conjugated AMB-PEG and free AmB, enabling the further characterization of these formulations. Using HPLC and dynamic light scattering analyses, it was observed that the AMB-PEG 2 formulation, having a higher molar ratio of 2 AMB: 1 PEG, possesses more free AMB and has relatively larger particle diameters compared to the AMB-PEG 1 formulation, that consists of 1 AMB: 1 PEG. The identity of the conjugate was also verified using mass spectrometry. AMB-PEG 2 demonstrates improved antifungal efficacy relative to AMB-PEG 1, without a concurrent increase in in vitro toxicity to mammalian cells, implying that the additional loading of free AMB in the AMB-PEG formulation can potentially increase its therapeutic index. Compared to unconjugated AMB, AMB-PEG formulations are less toxic to mammalian cells in vitro, even though their MIC50 values are comparatively higher in a variety of fungal strains tested.

The method was trimmed so that the complete analysis of the whole grain flour including sample preparation of up to 20 samples on one plate took less than 3 h (<9 min per sample) and total costs including sample preparation were <1.0 Euro/sample. Sample preparation of the complex wheat matrix was reduced to a minimum (only acidified methanol extraction of the ground whole wheat grain). Separation was well achieved on amino phases with a mixture of ethyl acetate, 2-butanone, water and formic acid. It was superior to the separation on either normal or reversed phases and more robust with regard to intrinsic pH variances of the sample extracts. Pattern recognition of anthocyanins was simply performed by visual detection (the image), a key feature of high-performance thin-layer chromatography. Wheat varieties and crosses with higher anthocyanin contents were easily selectable, and thus, successfully made out.

15664175,"Voltage-gated sodium channels with ""resurgent"" kinetics are specialized for high-frequency firing. The alpha subunits interact with a blocking protein that binds open channels upon depolarization and unbinds upon repolarization, producing resurgent sodium current. By limiting classical inactivation, the cycle of block and unblock shortens refractory periods. To characterize the blocker in Purkinje neurons, we briefly exposed inside-out patches to substrate-specific proteases. Trypsin and chymotrypsin each removed resurgent current, consistent with established roles for positively charged and hydrophobic/aromatic groups in blocking sodium channels. In Purkinje cells, the only known sodium channel-associated subunit that has a cytoplasmic sequence with several positive charges and clustered hydrophobic/aromatic residues is beta4 (KKLITFILKKTREK; beta4(154-167)). After enzymatic removal of block, beta4(154-167) fully reconstituted resurgent current, whereas scrambled or point-mutated peptides were ineffective. In CA3 pyramidal neurons, which lack beta4 and endogenous block, beta4(154-167) generated resurgent current.

Fistula formation may be traumatic or spontaneous. Eighty-six percent of spontaneous splenic AVFs occur in women, and 55% are associated with a preexisting splenic artery aneurysm. CASE REPORT A 64-year-old Caucasian female with unremarkable past medical history presented with new onset of left lower quadrant abdominal pain and persistent diarrhea. CTA demonstrated dilated mesenteric veins consistent with portal hypertension. A 1-cm splenic artery aneurysm associated with a splenic AVF was identified and confirmed by celiac angiography. The splenic artery was embolized both distal and proximal to and within the aneurysm sac. Completion arteriography showed minimal flow throughout the splenic artery, and there was no flow into the splenic AVF.

However, the factor structure of the various neurocognitive deficits, the relationship with symptoms and other variables, and the minimum amount of testing required to determine an adequate composite score has not been determined in typical patients with schizophrenia. An 'all-comer' approach to cognition is needed, as provided by the baseline assessment of an unprecedented number of patients in the CATIE (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness) schizophrenia trial. From academic sites and treatment providers representative of the community, 1493 patients with chronic schizophrenia were entered into the study, including those with medical comorbidity and substance abuse. Eleven neurocognitive tests were administered, resulting in 24 individual scores reduced to nine neurocognitive outcome measures, five domain scores and a composite score. Despite minimal screening procedures, 91.2% of patients provided meaningful neurocognitive data. Exploratory principal components analysis yielded one factor accounting for 45% of the test variance. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that a single-factor model comprised of five domain scores was the best fit. The correlations among the factors were medium to high, and scores on individual factors were very highly correlated with the single composite score. Neurocognitive deficits were modestly correlated with negative symptom severity (r=0.13-0.27), but correlations with positive symptom severity were near zero (r<0.08). Even in an 'all-comer' clinical trial, neurocognitive deficits can be assessed in the overwhelming majority of patients, and the severity of impairment is similar to meta-analytic estimates. Multiple analyses suggested that a broad cognitive deficit characterizes this sample. These deficits are modestly related to negative symptoms and essentially independent of positive symptom severity.",valid,

2460700,"This study examined the frequently heard claim that aphasic listeners have more difficulty understanding speech in situations where there are multiple speakers than in situations where there is a single speaker. Nine stories about everyday events were written and videotaped as monologues, dialogues with one dominant speaker, and dialogues with both speakers contributing comparable amounts of information. Eighteen aphasic and 9 non-brain-damaged adults watched and listened to the videotapes. Listeners' comprehension and retention of the stories were tested by yes/no questions following each story. The three versions of the stories were understood and remembered equally well by aphasic and non-brain-damaged listeners, suggesting that listening to two speakers does not appreciably increase comprehension difficulty. These results suggest that factors other than the extent to which different speakers contribute to the topic of conversation are responsible for aphasic listeners' reported difficulties in comprehending multiple-speaker conversational interactions.",valid,
15043929,"Macromolecular sedimentation in inhomogeneous media is of great practical importance. Dynamic density gradients have a long tradition in analytical ultracentrifugation, and are frequently used in preparative ultracentrifugation. In this paper, a new theoretical model for sedimentation in inhomogeneous media is presented, based on finite element solutions of the Lamm equation with spatial and temporal variation of the local solvent density and viscosity. It is applied to macromolecular sedimentation in the presence of a dynamic density gradient formed by the sedimentation of a co-solute at high concentration. It is implemented in the software SEDFIT for the analysis of experimental macromolecular concentration distributions. The model agrees well with the measured sedimentation profiles of a protein in a dynamic cesium chloride gradient, and may provide a measure for the effects of hydration or preferential solvation parameters. General features of protein sedimentation in dynamic density gradients are described.",valid,

27755771,"An analysis of the factors controlling rates of nitrogen cycling in northern temperate forest ecosystems is presented based on a quantitative analysis of an extensive data set for forests in Wisconsin and Massachusetts as those data are synthesized in a computer model (VEGIE) of organic matter and nutrient dynamics. The model is of the ""lumped-parameter,"" nutrient-flux-density type, dealing with major components of forest ecosystems rather than stems or species. It deals explicitly with the interactions among light, water, and nutrient availability in determining transient and equilibrium rates of primary production and nutrient cycling. Data are presented for parameterizing the plant component of the system at either the species or community level. A major conclusion is that the ultimate control on equilibrium nitrogen-cycling rates resides not within the nitrogen cycle itself (for example in litter quality or net primary production [NPP] allocation patterns) but rather in ratios of resource-use efficiency by vegetation as compared with the ratios of resource availability. Litter quality and allocation patterns, along with rates of N deposition, do affect the rate at which a system approaches the equilibrium cycling rate. The model is used to explain observed variation in nitrogen-cycling rates among forest types, and to predict the timing and occurrence of ""nitrogen saturation"" (N availability in excess of biotic demand) as a function of nitrogen deposition rates and harvesting.",valid,

3420112,"Cysteamine (beta-mercaptoethylamine, CSH) has been reported to have various effects on the neuroendocrine system. Reports indicate CSH decreases pituitary oxytocin (OT) without affecting pituitary vasopressin (VP). However, preliminary studies from our laboratory strongly indicate that CSH has an effect on VP release. Experiments were conducted with dibenzyline-treated, urethane-anesthetized, male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Rats were injected with 4 mU of standard VP and 4 mg/100 g of CSH. Administration of VP resulted in an increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 23.5 +/- 3.2 mm Hg. Administration of CSH resulted in a consistent, immediate decrease in MAP of 13.0 +/- 2.0 mm Hg prior to an increase of 21.0 +/- 2.6 mm Hg. The effects due to VP and CSH were strikingly different; the CSH-induced MAP rise took longer to peak and to return to baseline. Both the VP- and CSH-induced MAP rise were markedly inhibited by a prior administration of a specific VP antagonist d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)]AVP. In addition, the typical increase in MAP observed in SD rats following CSH administration was substantially reduced when the same dose was administered in homozygous diabetes insipidus (HODI) rats. The data presented here strongly suggest that CSH-induced MAP elevation is due to the release of VP from the pituitary gland.",valid,

The aim of this work was to determine if changes in apple physiology caused by the proliferation of fungal decay organisms would foster the survival of E. coli O157:H7. Trials were performed where (A) plant pathogens (4 log10 spores) were added to apple wounds 4 days before the wounds were inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 (3 log10 CFU g(-1) apple) (both RT and 4 degrees C storage), (B) plant pathogens and E. coli O157:H7 were added on the same day (both RT and 4 degrees C storage), and (C) E. coli O157:H7 was added 2 days (RT storage) and 4 days (4 degrees C storage) before plant pathogens. In all trials E. coli O157:H7 levels generally declined to <1 log10 at 4 degrees C storage, and in the presence of P. expansum at 4 degrees C or RT. However, in the presence of G. cingulata at RT E. coli O157:H7 numbers increased from 3.18 to 4.03 log10 CFU g(-1) in the apple wound during trial A, from 3.26 to 6.31 log10 CFU g(-1) during trial B, and from 3.22 to 6.81 log10 CFU g(-1) during trial C. This effect is probably a consequence of the attendant rise in pH from 4.1 to approximately 6.8, observed with the proliferation of G. cingulata rot. Control apples (inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 only) were contaminated with opportunistic decay organisms at RT during trials A and B, leading to E. coli O157:H7 death. However, E. coli O157:H7 in control apples in trial C, where no contamination occurred, increased from 3.22 to 5.97 log10 CFU g(-1).

To study the effect of IF alongside CR, we imposed IF in FVB/N mice or IF combined with CR using the transgenic FVB/N alphaMUPA mice that, when fed ad libitum, exhibit spontaneously reduced eating and extended life span. Our results show that when food was introduced during the light period, body temperature peak was not disrupted. In contrast, IF caused almost arrhythmicity in clock gene expression in the liver and advanced mPer2 and mClock expression. However, IF restored the amplitudes of clock gene expression under disruptive light condition regardless whether the animals were calorically restricted or not. Unlike daytime feeding, nighttime feeding yielded rhythms similar to those generated during ad libitum feeding. Taken together, our results show that IF can affect circadian rhythms differently depending on the timing of food availability, and suggest that this regimen induces a metabolic state that affects the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) clock.",valid,

Divided into subclasses based on sequence characteristics and substrate specificity, these integral membrane transporters play key roles in metal homeostasis, metal tolerance, and the biosynthesis of metalloproteins. The P(1B-4)-ATPases have the simplest architecture of the five P(1B)-ATPase families and have been suggested to play a role in Co(2+) transport. A P(1B-4)-ATPase from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS-14.1, designated sCoaT, has been cloned, expressed, and purified. Activity assays indicate that sCoaT is specific for Co(2+). A single Co(2+) binding site is present, and optical, electron paramagnetic resonance, and X-ray absorption spectroscopic data are consistent with tetrahedral coordination by oxygen and nitrogen ligands, including a histidine and likely a water. Surprisingly, there is no evidence for coordination by sulfur. Mutation of a conserved cysteine residue, Cys 327, in the signature transmembrane Ser-Pro-Cys metal binding motif does not abolish the ATP hydrolysis activity or affect the spectroscopic analysis, establishing that this residue is not involved in the initial Co(2+) binding by sCoaT. In contrast, replacements of conserved transmembrane residues Ser 325, His 657, Glu 658, and Thr 661 with alanine abolish ATP hydrolysis activity and Co(2+) binding, indicating that these residues are necessary for Co(2+) transport.

Therefore, the authors utilized a simplified gingivoperiosteoplasty technique by inserting one or two large, triangular-shaped mucoperiosteal flaps on the opposite side in a tongue-in-groove or interdigitation fashion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of this simplified gingivoperiosteoplasty technique at the age of permanent canine eruption. Forty nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate patients who had undergone simplified gingivoperiosteoplasty were retrospectively reviewed. Canine eruption and the bone formation rate of the interalveolar septum using the Bergland method and a modified Long et al. method were evaluated. A total of 55 alveolar cleft sites were treated. Simplified gingivoperiosteoplasty was performed at a mean age of 13.4 months, and the mean age at the time of follow-up was 14.3 years. The overall success rate of simplified gingivoperiosteoplasty was 50.90%. With regard to cleft types, clefts of the primary palate and unilateral alveolar clefts showed a significantly higher success rate than clefts of the primary and secondary palates and bilateral alveolar clefts, respectively. Our gingivoperiosteoplasty technique is a simple surgical procedure and is performed at 12 months of age, at which time the cleft alveolus has grown sufficiently, to ensure the success of the delicate surgical technique.

9353857,"The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic relevance of relatives' interactive behaviour towards the patient, as covered by the Münster Family Interview (MFI), to the further course of the schizophrenic illness. The MFI is a family interview (of the whole family, including the patient) designed to record the emotional family atmosphere based on the concept of expressed emotion (EE). The ratings take place directly after the interview on five scales (criticism, hostility, overinvolvement, resignation and warmth), the resignation scale being added to the 'classic' EE scales. Ninety-nine families of outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to the DSM-III were examined with the MFI during a home visit. The patients were seen 1 and 2 years after the first examination. The target criteria selected for the prognostic significance of the interaction measurements were: rehospitalisation within 2 years; extent of symptoms after 1 year, and psychosocial skills after 1 year. The significance of the interaction dimensions was verified in regression models. The control variable used in the regression models was the Strauss-Carpenter scale. Regression models were produced for the total group and for a subgroup of moderately ill patients. All target criteria yielded serviceable prediction models. The most important variable for prediction was the control variable, the Strauss-Carpenter scale. However the interaction variables made additional contributions to the prognosis, especially in the subgroup of moderately ill patients. The best MFI scale for all the outcome criteria was resignation; criticism predicted only the symptomatology, and emotional overinvolvement the level of social functioning after 1 year. In conclusion, practical work with families of schizophrenic patients should emphasise the protective function of relatives towards patients more strongly.",valid,

23549407,"There is a high incidence of metabolic syndrome among patients with primary aldosteronism (PA), which has recently been associated with an unfavorable cardiometabolic profile. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been clarified in detail. Characterizing aldosterone (Ald) target genes in adipocytes will help us to elucidate the deleterious effects associated with excess Ald. Apelin, a novel adipokine, exerts beneficial effects on obesity-associated disorders and cardiovascular homeostasis. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of high Ald levels on apelin expression and secretion and the underlying mechanisms involved in adipocytes. In vivo, a single-dose Ald injection acutely decreased apelin serum levels and adipose tissue apelin production, which demonstrates a clear inverse relationship between the levels of plasma Ald and plasma apelin. Experiments using 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed that Ald decreased apelin expression and secretion in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This effect was reversed by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists or GR (NR3C1) knockdown; furthermore, putative HREs were identified in the apelin promoter. Subsequently, we verified that both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids regulated apelin expression through GR activation, although no synergistic effect was observed. Additionally, detailed potential mechanisms involved a p38 MAPK signaling pathway. In conclusion, our findings strengthen the fact that there is a direct interaction between Ald and apelin in adipocytes, which has important implications for hyperaldosteronism or PA-associated cardiometabolic syndrome and hoists apelin on the list of potent therapeutic targets for PA.",valid,

Although such bursts were observed between 23 and 37 degrees C, optimal recording of discrete epileptiform activity was achieved at 29 +/- 1 degrees C. Decreasing extracellular calcium or increasing extracellular concentrations of potassium enhanced burst discharges. Proconvulsant agents initiated both interictal and ictal epileptiform events. This, together with the reduction of epileptiform activity by standard anticonvulsant drugs such as carbamazepine and phenobarbitone suggested that this in vitro model may be useful for studying the pharmacology of epileptogenesis and for developing new therapeutic strategies for epilepsy.",valid,
16133256,"Micropropagated rose plants (Rosa hybrida L., cv. New Dawn) were inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices (Schenk and Smith) and subjected to different drought regimens. The dual objectives of these experiments were to investigate the mechanism and the extent to which AM can prevent drought damages and whether physiological analyses reveal enhanced drought tolerance of an economically important plant such as the rose. In a long-term drought experiment with four different water regimens, visual scoring of wilt symptoms affirmed that AM in a selected host-symbiont combination increased plant performance. This effect was mostly expressed if moderate drought stress was constantly applied over a long period. In a short-term experiment in which severe drought stress was implemented and plants were allowed to recover after 4 or 9 days, no visual differences between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roses were observed. Therefore, the early physiological steps conferring drought tolerance were prone to investigation. Proline content in leaves proved to be an unsuitable marker for AM-induced drought tolerance, whereas analysis of chlorophyll a fluorescence using the JIP test (collecting stress-induced changes of the polyphasic O-J-I-P fluorescence kinetics in a non-destructive tissue screening) was more explanatory. Parameters derived from this test could describe the extent of foliar stress response and help to differentiate physiological mechanisms of stress tolerance. AM led to a more intense electron flow and a higher productive photosynthetic activity at several sites of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. A K step, known as a stress indicator of general character, appeared in the fluorescence transient only in drought-stressed non-mycorrhizal plants; conversely, the data elucidate a stabilising effect of AM on the oxygen-evolving complex at the donor site of photosystem (PS) II and at the electron-transport chain between PS II and PS I. If drought stress intensity was reduced by a prolonged and milder drying phase, these significant tolerance features were less pronounced or missing, indicating a possible threshold level for mycorrhizal tolerance induction.",valid,

30574116,"The perception of gaze direction involves the integration of a number of sensory cues exterior to the eye-region. The orientation of the head is one such cue, which has an overall repulsive effect on the perceived direction of gaze. However, in a recent experiment, we found the measured effect of head orientation on perceived gaze direction differed within subjects, depending on whether a single- or two-interval task design was employed. This suggests a potential difference in the way the orientation of the head is integrated into the perception of gaze direction across tasks. Four experiments were conducted to investigate this difference. The first two experiments showed that the difference was not the result of some interaction between stimuli in the two-interval task, but rather, a difference between the types of judgment being made across tasks, where observers were making a directional (left/right) judgment in the single-interval task, and a non-directional (direct/indirect gaze) judgment in the two-interval task. A third experiment showed that this difference does not arise from observers utilizing a non-directional cue to direct gaze (the circularity of the pupil/iris) in making their non-directional judgments. The fourth experiment showed no substantial differences in the duration of evidence accumulation and processing between judgments, suggesting that observers are not integrating different sensory information across tasks. Together these experiments show that the sensory information from head orientation is flexibly weighted in the perception of gaze direction, and that the purpose of the observer, in sampling gaze information, can influence the consequent perception of gaze direction.",valid,6291513

18690111,"Antidepressant drugs produce therapeutic actions and many of their side effects via blockade of the plasma membrane transporters for serotonin (SERT/SLC6A2), norepinephrine (NET/SLC6A1), and dopamine (DAT/SLC6A3). Many antidepressants block several of these transporters; some are more selective. Mouse gene knockouts of these transporters provide interesting models for possible effects of chronic antidepressant treatments. To examine the role of monoamine transporters in models of depression DAT, NET, and SERT knockout (KO) mice and wild-type littermates were studied in the forced swim test (FST), the tail suspension test, and for sucrose consumption. To dissociate general activity from potential antidepressant effects three types of behavior were assessed in the FST: immobility, climbing, and swimming. In confirmation of earlier reports, both DAT KO and NET KO mice exhibited less immobility than wild-type littermates whereas SERT KO mice did not. Effects of DAT deletion were not simply because of hyperactivity, as decreased immobility was observed in DAT+/- mice that were not hyperactive as well as in DAT-/- mice that displayed profound hyperactivity. Climbing was increased, whereas swimming was almost eliminated in DAT-/- mice, and a modest but similar effect was seen in NET KO mice, which showed a modest decrease in locomotor activity. Combined increases in climbing and decreases in immobility are characteristic of FST results in antidepressant animal models, whereas selective effects on swimming are associated with the effects of stimulant drugs. Therefore, an effect on climbing is thought to more specifically reflect antidepressant effects, as has been observed in several other proposed animal models of reduced depressive phenotypes. A similar profile was observed in the tail suspension test, where DAT, NET, and SERT knockouts were all found to reduce immobility, but much greater effects were observed in DAT KO mice. However, to further determine whether these effects of DAT KO in animal models of depression may be because of the confounding effects of hyperactivity, mice were also assessed in a sucrose consumption test. Sucrose consumption was increased in DAT KO mice consistent with reduced anhedonia, and inconsistent with competitive hyperactivity; no increases were observed in SERT KO or NET KO mice. In summary, the effects of DAT KO in animal models of depression are larger than those produced by NET or SERT KO, and unlikely to be simply the result of the confounding effects of locomotor hyperactivity; thus, these data support reevaluation of the role that DAT expression could play in depression and the potential antidepressant effects of DAT blockade.",valid,2644662

In certain recovery circumstances, the most dimorphic skeletal areas, such as the pelvis, are absent or fragmented; in that case, other bones of the skeleton, including the clavicle and scapula, can be used to predict sex. The purpose of this research is to generate new models for the estimation of sex with clavicular and scapular measurements using a study-sample of 129 individuals with clavicle (65 males and 64 females) and 112 individuals with scapula (50 males and 62 females) from the Lisbon Identified Skeletal Collection (Portugal). A decision tree classifier (C4.5) and logistic regression (LR) were employed to create univariable and multivariable sex prediction models. Accuracy under cross-validation of the classification models is high (up to 93.8%), with minimal bias (<5%), particularly in the multivariable models. The proposed LR models facilitate the probabilistic estimation of biological sex, accounting for the significant overlap in the expression of sexual dimorphism.",valid,

18852102,"Phylogenetic analysis depends on inferential methodology estimating accurately the degree of divergence between sequences. Inaccurate estimates can lead to misleading evolutionary inferences, including incorrect tree topology estimates and poor dating of historical species divergence. Protein coding sequences are ubiquitous in phylogenetic inference, but many of the standard methods commonly used to describe their evolution do not explicitly account for the dependencies between sites in a codon induced by the genetic code. This study evaluates the performance of several standard methods on datasets simulated under a simple substitution model, describing codon evolution under a range of different types of selective pressures. This approach also offers insights into the relative performance of different phylogenetic methods when there are dependencies acting between the sites in the data. Methods based on statistical models performed well when there was no or limited purifying selection in the simulated sequences (low degree of dependency between sites in a codon), although more biologically realistic models tended to outperform simpler models. Phylogenetic methods exhibited greater variability in performance for sequences simulated under strong purifying selection (high degree of the dependencies between sites in a codon). Simple models substantially underestimate the degree of divergence between sequences, and underestimation was more pronounced on the internal branches of the tree. This underestimation resulted in some statistical methods performing poorly and exhibiting evidence for systematic bias in tree inference. Amino acid-based and nucleotide models that contained generic descriptions of spatial and temporal heterogeneity, such as mixture and temporal hidden Markov models, coped notably better, producing more accurate estimates of evolutionary divergence and the tree topology.",valid,2607415
2118505,"Secondary site mutations that restore sporulation to sporulation-defective spo0F or spo0B deletion mutants were found to reside in the spo0A gene. Sequence analysis of 23 such sof mutants showed that the sof mutations fell into six classes of missense codon changes, primarily in the conserved amino-terminal domain of the response regulator Spo0A protein. Changes were observed in codons 12, 14, 60, 92, and 121. The residues affected were predominantly located in the potential turn regions at one end of the amino-terminal conserved domain on the same topological face as the active site aspartate residues. The ability of sof mutations to suppress deficiencies in the transmitter kinases, KinA and KinB, of two-component regulatory systems was tested. All of the sof mutations suppressed the sporulation deficiency of kinA mutants but only two classes among five tested suppressed kinB mutations. sof mutants segregated Spo- colonies at high frequency. Five of these Spo- mutants were found to result from mutations in the spo0A locus that reversed the effect of the sof mutatation. One of these was sequenced and found to have the original sof mutation and a new mutation, sos, at codon 105. The accumulation of sos mutations in sof strains suggested that the sof mutations have a subtle, yet deleterious, effect on the growth of the cell. The results suggested that the sof mutations increase the avidity for or reactivity with transmitter kinases in an allele-specific manner, although in some cases it is possible that the sof mutations obviate the need for phosphorylation to activate the Spo0A protein. An alternative hypothesis is presented in which the sof mutations play the role of bypass mutations for kinases.",valid,213157

In this study, we used a Cdkn2a-deficient mouse melanocyte cell line to screen for secondary genetic events in melanoma tumor progression. Upon investigation, intrachromosomal gene amplification of Met, a receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in melanoma progression, was identified in Cdkn2a-deficient tumors. RNA interference targeting Met in these tumor cells resulted in a significant delay in tumor growth in vivo compared with the control cells.

Currently, transplantation is determined via the Milan criteria-patients within Milan (single tumor < 5 cm or 2-3 tumors < 3 cm with no extrahepatic spread nor intrahepatic vascular invasion) are typically eligible for transplantation. However, combining microRNA expression profiling with the Milan criteria can improve prediction of recurrence.

Indeed, PV IgG recognise a wide spectrum of molecules and enabled us to monitor the main changes occurring in acantholytic keratinocytes, including cell shrinkage with the appearance of prickle-like processes, detachment of keratinocytes from one another and collapse of cytoskeleton-bound proteins along nuclear periphery. This method has wider applications as it could be useful for staining cell periphery of keratinocytes and changes in cell shape.

12657456,"Cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) are often used to analyze activity-dependent neuronal selection occurring during brain development. The CGNs survive long only when the culture medium contains a depolarizing agent. However, it is argued whether the depolarization critical for survival is of presynaptic or postsynaptic compartment. Since CGNs form no synapses among them, it is generally assumed that the latter would be the case. But it is possible that the depolarization would induce exocytosis of survival-promoting substances whether or not CGNs form synapses. Here we directly examined the exocytotic activities of CGNs under survival-promoting and survival-limiting conditions by electron microscopy to support this possibility. CGNs possessed clusters of synaptic vesicle-like vesicles (SVVs) in neuritic varicosities. CGNs cultured in high-KCl medium had significantly smaller SVV clusters than those cultured in low-KCl medium. The number of SVVs increased when the high KCl-cultured CGNs were transferred to low-KCl medium, indicating a sustained high rate of exocytosis in high-KCl medium. The majority of the varicosities containing SVVs were not apposed to definite postsynaptic structures, indicating that exocytosis occurs from a non-synaptic surface. Fluorescence Ca(2+) imaging revealed that the high KCl-cultured CGNs had spots of high Ca(2+) along their neurites, corresponding to the varicosities.",valid,
15631490,"(13)C CPMAS NMR has been investigated in application to protein samples with a variety of deuteration patterns. Samples were prepared with protons in either all hydrogen positions, only in the exchangeable sites, or in the exchangeable sites plus select methyl groups. CP dynamics, T(1) relaxation times, and (13)C line widths have been compared. Using ubiquitin as a model system, reasonable (1)H-(13)C CP transfer is observed for the extensively deuterated samples. In the absence of deuterium decoupling, the (13)C line widths observed for the deuterated samples are identical to those observed for the perprotio samples with a MAS rate of 20 kHz. Extensive deuteration has little effect on the T(1) of the exchangeable protons. On the basis of these observations, it is clear that there are no substantive compromises accompanying the use of extensive deuteration in the design of (1)H, (15)N, or (13)C solid-state NMR methods.",valid,

This exploratory review focused on psychological counselling for genetic risk diagnosis. This study aimed to address the psychological management of the impact of genetic risk on chronic diseases. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Scopus for articles from May 2012 to August 2023. A descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the included studies was conducted. Based on the exclusion/inclusion criteria, the literature search yielded 250 studies. Seventeen full texts were assessed for eligibility and 207 articles were excluded. Observational (n = 15) and randomised clinical trials (n = 2) were examined. Most studies have been conducted on oncological diagnoses; the emotional dimensions examined have been worry, depression, anxiety and stress in most diseases. Psychological measures are based on self-reports and questionnaires; few studies have investigated the connections between quality of life, psychological traits and emotional dimensions. The complexity of clinics and from daily diagnostic and treatment practices to the everyday experience of those living with the risk of disease might be addressed in counselling settings to improve quality of life in genetic risk, increasing mental adaptation to tailored chronic conditions. Thus, the empowerment of communication of genetic risk information should be part of the general trend towards personalised medicine.",valid,

It is of enormous clinical importance to identify agents that can promote the generation and differentiation of functional iTreg cells. We have established a phenotypic screening platform to identify new compounds that can promote the TGFβ-mediated iTreg differentiation. We have found Kenpaullone, a potent CDK1, CDK2 and CDK5 inhibitor, as new enhancer for iTreg cell differentiation. Kenpaullone promotes iTreg cell differentiation through increased and prolonged transcription of foxp3 gene by enhancing TGFβ-Smad3 signaling pathway. Thus, we have demonstrated that CDK2 is the biological target of Kenpaullone and proven that CDK2 is a novel negative regulator of iTreg cell differentiation.",valid,
15804377,"Characterization of infective metacyclic promastigotes of Leishmania spp can be an essential step in several experimental protocols. Metacyclic forms of all Leishmania species display a typical morphology with short, narrow cell body, and an elongated flagellum. This feature suggests that metacyclics can be distinguished from procyclic forms by non-fluorimetric flow cytometric parameters thus enabling the follow-up of their appearance and acquisition of specific properties, during metacyclogenesis in in vitro cultures. Here we describe the flow cytometric parameters of stage-specific promastigotes of Leishmania major, Leishmania donovani, Leishmania amazonensis, and Leishmania braziliensis. Our findings were validated by optical microscopy morphology and specific procyclic labeling with FITC-peanut agglutinin. Furthermore, we show that parasite's distribution in the plot during differentiation in culture is not species specific and that the parasites displaying low forward-angle light scatter (FSC(low)) are three times more infective than the FSC(high) ones. The method here described can be applied to the identification of metacyclics of different Leishmania spp within the whole stationary population.",valid,

Advances in catheter- and surgery-based cardiac interventions have rendered almost all types of CHD amenable to complete correction or at least palliation. Patient survival has increased, and a new patient population, referred to as adult CHD (ACHD) patients, has emerged. Implanted prosthetic material paves the way for cardiovascular device-related infections, but studies on the management of CHD-associated IE in the era of cardiovascular devices are scarce. The types of heart malformation (unrepaired, repaired, palliated) substantially differ in their lifetime risks for IE. Streptococci and staphylococci are the predominant pathogens. Right-sided IE is more frequently seen in patients with CHD. Relevant comorbidity caused by cardiac and extracardiac episode-related complications is high. Transesophageal echocardiography is recommended for more precise visualization of vegetations, especially in complex type of CHD in ACHD patients. Antimicrobial therapy and surgical management of IE remain challenging, but outcome of CHD-associated IE from the neonate to the adult is better than in other forms of IE.",valid,

This study compared several published cryopreservation techniques to find the most efficient for rhesus macaques. Effectiveness was assessed by sperm longevity (post-thaw motility % and duration) and ability to hyperactivate in response to chemical activators (caffeine, dibutyryl cyclic AMP). Each ejaculate from three males was treated with four published cryopreservation protocols (Seier et al. 1993; Sanchez-Partida et al. 2000; Si et al. 2000; Isachenko et al. 2005). Upon thawing, each sub-sample was incubated either at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 in air with or without activators or at approximately 22 degrees C in atmospheric air without activators for 0-24 h. Samples cryopreserved using one method showed zero motility and were not included in the 2 ;2 G-test statistical analysis. The other methods all demonstrated good immediate post-thaw motility rates (68%, 73% and 62% respectively) and underwent capacitation after exposure to activators. Sperm motility in each treatment decreased over time at both temperatures but overall, incubation at 22 degrees C preserved motility better in all three methods. In summary, cryopreservation of rhesus spermatozoa using the method published by Sanchez-Partida et al. or Seier et al. appeared best, potentially supporting gene banking as well as allowing for multiple IVF uses from the same sample.",valid,

16157670,"The extent to which epistasis contributes to adaptation, population differentiation, and speciation is a long-standing and important problem in evolutionary genetics. Using recombinant inbred (RI) lines of Arabidopsis thaliana grown under natural field conditions, we have examined the genetic architecture of fitness-correlated traits with respect to epistasis; we identified both single-locus additive and two-locus epistatic QTL for natural variation in fruit number, germination, and seed length and width. For fruit number, we found seven significant epistatic interactions, but only two additive QTL. For seed germination, length, and width, there were from two to four additive QTL and from five to eight epistatic interactions. The epistatic interactions were both positive and negative. In each case, the magnitude of the epistatic effects was roughly double that of the effects of the additive QTL, varying from -41% to +29% for fruit number and from -5% to +4% for seed germination, length, and width. A number of the QTL that we describe participate in more than one epistatic interaction, and some loci identified as additive also may participate in an epistatic interaction; the genetic architecture for fitness traits may be a network of additive and epistatic effects. We compared the map positions of the additive and epistatic QTL for germination, seed width, and seed length from plants grown in both the field and the greenhouse. While the total number of significant additive and epistatic QTL was similar under the two growth conditions, the map locations were largely different. We found a small number of significant epistatic QTL x environment effects when we tested directly for them. Our results support the idea that epistatic interactions are an important part of natural genetic variation and reinforce the need for caution in comparing results from greenhouse-grown and field-grown plants.",valid,1456117
20362398,"The risk of mortality is high in burn patients and correlates with age, burn area extent, and sepsis. Immunosuppression has been reported to occur after severe burn. Cytotoxic cells possess specialized granules containing perforin and a group of serine proteases (granzymes). Granzyme A is a serine protease constitutively expressed by gammadelta and NK cells, in agreement with their functional cytolytic potential. In vitro studies have shown that GrA may be released extracellularly during cytotoxic cell degranulation, indicating the activation of cytotoxic cells. The aim of our study was to determine plasma GrA activity in burned patients and to verify if decreased GrA levels were associated with poor prognosis. Specific GrA activity was tested in the plasma of burned and healthy subjects by esterase assay. Plasma GrA was significantly decreased in septic rather than in nonseptic burn patients and in healthy subjects (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). At day 3 plasma GrA was significantly lower in nonsurvivor than in survivor septic patients (p < 0.05). The value of 91 mOD showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 84% in differentiating survivor from nonsurvivor septic patients. Because this is a retrospective study, Granzyme A is not a confirmed predictor of septic outcome after burn, but its determination could give useful information about the development and severity of sepsis.",valid,

Pracownia was charge by ELN with a task of conducting the standardisation in polish molecular biology laboratories. Test probes were prepared and sent to eight cooperating laboratories. The results obtained in six laboratories were concordant with results from laboratory in Krakow after conversion to international scale, therefore it was possible to calculate individual correction factors.

A secondary objective was to test potential mediators of the hypothesized effect (behavioral intention, self-efficacy and control beliefs). A total of 204 adults newly diagnosed (≤6 months) with Type 2 diabetes participated in the study, which included a baseline assessment of domain-general and domain-specific time perspective, as well as strength of intention to perform two weight-management behaviors (dietary choice and physical activity); both weight-management behaviors were assessed again at 6 month follow-up. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed a prospective association between domain-specific time perspective and uptake of weight management behaviors. Individuals with newly diagnosed T2DM possessing a future-oriented time perspective reported making less frequent fatty food choices and greater increases in physical activity over the 6-month follow-up interval. These effects were selectively mediated by intention strength, and not competing social cognitive variables. For both behaviors, the total effects and meditational models were robust to adjustments for demographics, body composition and disease variables. A future-oriented time perspective is prospectively associated with superior uptake of weight management behaviors among those with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes. The facilitating effect of future-oriented thinking appears to occur via enhanced strength of intentions to perform weight management behaviors.",valid,

In this study, the effects of long-term miglitol treatment on metabolic control, C-peptide secretion, hepatic glucose output, and peripheral insulin sensitivity (euglycemic clamp) were tested in 15 type II diabetic patients (8 receiving insulin, 7 receiving oral hypoglycemic agents). For 8 wk they received either miglitol (300 mg/day) or placebo with a double-blind crossover design that had a 4-wk washout period between treatments. Miglitol therapy induced a reduction of postprandial blood glucose levels (miglitol compared with placebo; areas under the curve; P less than .002), whereas fasting blood glucose levels were not influenced. Miglitol caused a slight reduction of glycosylated hemoglobin levels (mean +/- SE miglitol and placebo 9.50 +/- 0.3 and 10.0 +/- 0.4%, respectively; P less than .05), which was more pronounced in insulin-treated patients. Miglitol caused a reduction of postprandial C-peptide increase (P less than .03). Hepatic glucose output (both in the basal state and during euglycemic clamp conditions) and peripheral insulin sensitivity were not influenced by miglitol therapy. Specific side effects were observed in 11 patients; in 6 patients only to a moderate degree. Long-term miglitol treatment induces a persistent reduction of postprandial blood glucose increase. This effect is more pronounced in type II diabetic patients on insulin therapy, which can cause a moderate improvement of overall metabolic control.",valid,
28725682,"Non-motor symptoms (NMS) are a key component of Parkinson's disease (PD). A range of NMS, most notably impaired sense of smell, sleep dysfunction, and dysautonomia are present from the 'pre-motor' phase to the final palliative stage. Theories as to the pathogenesis of PD such as those proposed by Braak and others also support the occurrence of NMS in PD years before motor symptoms start. However, research addressing the range and nature of NMS in PD has been confounded by the fact that many NMS arise as part of drug-related side effects. Thus, drug-naive PD (DNPD) patients provide an ideal population to study the differences in the presentation of NMS. The aim of this paper is therefore to systematically review all the available studies of NMS in DNPD patients. We believe this is the first review of its kind. The current review confirms the increasing research being conducted into NMS in DNPD patients as well as the necessity for further investigation into less-studied NMS, such as pain. Moreover, the data confirms non-motor heterogeneity among PD patients, and, therefore, further research into the concept of non-motor subtyping is encouraged. The review suggests that the clinical assessment of NMS should be integral to any assessment of PD in clinical and research settings.",valid,5516558
23349711,"Many practical problems in almost all scientific and technological disciplines have been classified as computationally hard (NP-hard or even NP-complete). In life sciences, combinatorial optimization problems frequently arise in molecular biology, e.g., genome sequencing; global alignment of multiple genomes; identifying siblings or discovery of dysregulated pathways. In almost all of these problems, there is the need for proving a hypothesis about certain property of an object that can be present if and only if it adopts some particular admissible structure (an NP-certificate) or be absent (no admissible structure), however, none of the standard approaches can discard the hypothesis when no solution can be found, since none can provide a proof that there is no admissible structure. This article presents an algorithm that introduces a novel type of solution method to ""efficiently"" solve the graph 3-coloring problem; an NP-complete problem. The proposed method provides certificates (proofs) in both cases: present or absent, so it is possible to accept or reject the hypothesis on the basis of a rigorous proof. It provides exact solutions and is polynomial-time (i.e., efficient) however parametric. The only requirement is sufficient computational power, which is controlled by the parameter α∈N. Nevertheless, here it is proved that the probability of requiring a value of α>k to obtain a solution for a random graph decreases exponentially: P(α>k)≤2(-(k+1)), making tractable almost all problem instances. Thorough experimental analyses were performed. The algorithm was tested on random graphs, planar graphs and 4-regular planar graphs.

16633665,"The X-ray absorption near-edge structures (XANES) at the F K-edge of alpha-AlF(3), beta-AlF(3) and a tetragonal AlF(3) phase are analysed by a combination of ab initio calculations with the FEFF8 code and a phenomenological discussion of local molecular orbital (MO) symmetries at the absorbing fluorine atoms. By means of a Walsh correlation diagram it is shown that the two intense absorption bands observed at the F K-edges of the AlF(3) polymorphs can be interpreted as transitions to anti-bonding MOs in [Al-F-Al]-units that have C(2v) and D(infinity h) point group symmetries. The energies of both anti-bonding orbitals are very insensitive to the angle between the Al-F bonds, which explains the close similarity of the XANES signatures from the three polymorphs. The FEFF8 analysis shows that the increased broadening of the XANES structure for beta-AlF(3) and the tetragonal AlF(3) phase is due to the superposition of the individual absorption spectra from the crystallographically distinct F species. The interpretation in terms of local MOs provides for the first time a ""chemically intuitive"" approach to investigations of solid fluorides by XANES spectroscopy and provides a simple conceptual framework for the discussion of the electronic structure in AlF(3) materials.",valid,
32245258,"The main purpose of the study was to develop a high accuracy system able to diagnose skin lesions using deep learning-based methods. We propose a new decision system based on multiple classifiers like neural networks and feature-based methods. Each classifier (method) gives the final decision system a certain weight, depending on the calculated accuracy, helping the system make a better decision. First, we created a neural network (NN) that can differentiate melanoma from benign nevus. The NN architecture is analyzed by evaluating it during the training process. Some biostatistic parameters, such as accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and Dice coefficient are calculated. Then, we developed three other methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNNs were pre-trained using large ImageNet and Places365 databases. GoogleNet, ResNet-101, and NasNet-Large, were used in the enumeration order. CNN architectures were fine-tuned in order to distinguish the different types of skin lesions using transfer learning. The accuracies of the classifications were determined. The last proposed method uses the classical method of image object detection, more precisely, the one in which some features are extracted from the images, followed by the classification step. In this case, the classification was done by using a support vector machine. Just as in the first method, the sensitivity, specificity, Dice similarity coefficient and accuracy are determined. A comparison of the obtained results from all the methods is then done. As mentioned above, the novelty of this paper is the integration of these methods in a global fusion-based decision system that uses the results obtained by each individual method to establish the fusion weights.

However, the contents and distribution of cyclopeptides in these lethal mushrooms remain poorly known. In this study, the diversity of major cyclopeptide toxins in seven Amanita species from Eastern Asia and three species from Europe and North America were systematically analyzed, and a new approach to inferring phylogenetic relationships using cyclopeptide profile was evaluated for the first time. The results showed that there were diversities of the cyclopeptides among lethal Amanita species, and cyclopeptides from Amanita rimosa and Amanita fuligineoides were reported for the first time. The amounts of amatoxins in East Asian Amanita species were significantly higher than those in European and North American species. The analysis of distribution of amatoxins and phallotoxins in various Amanita species demonstrated that the content of phallotoxins was higher than that of amatoxins in Amanita phalloides and Amanita virosa. In contrast, the content of phallotoxins was significantly lower than that of amatoxins in all East Asian lethal Amanita species tested. However, the distribution of amatoxins and phallotoxins in different tissues showed the same tendency.

We have characterized the processing of the endoplasmic reticulum-restricted glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus, termed poison tail (Gpt), biochemically and enzymatically, and by T cell recognition assays. Expressed with a vaccinia vector, Gpt remains endoglycosidase H-sensitive and does not mature to endoglycosidase D sensitivity. The protein is degraded in the ER with a T1/2 of 4 h. Gpt peptides are not secreted since Gpt-infected cells are unable to sensitize uninfected antigen-presenting cells in an innocent bystander assay. Using flow cytometry, Gpt is undetectable on the plasma membrane; in contrast, wild-type G is readily found on the surface or secreted into the milieu as soluble G following infection of A20 cells with a vaccinia recombinant expressing G. The degradation of Gpt is sensitive to the thiol reagent diamide and occurs optimally at physiological pH. A series of proteolytic inhibitors were tested: 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone inhibited degradation, which suggests the involvement of a serine protease. The degradation does not require transport to the Golgi complex, and is not sensitive to a variety of lysosomotropic agents. We show that the degradation products include the immunogenic epitopes recognized by a panel of T cell clones and hybridomas.",valid,7163747

This nutritional supplement may benefit athletes who undergo rigorous training by maintaining their gastrointestinal functions and overall health. In this study the influence of moderate physical exercise using a graded treadmill exercise, alone or in combination with the consumption of a soy product fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum LAB12 (LAB12), on tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) responses was investigated in a murine model. Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into four groups of six mice each (control, exercise alone, LAB12 and LAB12 + exercise). Mice treated with the potential probiotic LAB12 were orally gavaged for 42 days. At autopsy, blood and spleen from the animals were collected. The splenocytes were cultured in the presence of a mitogen, concanavalin A (Con A). The amount of TNF-α produced by the Con A-stimulated splenocytes was quantified using ELISA, while their proliferation was determined using the [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation method. This study shows that LAB12-supplemented and exercise-induced mice showed marked increase (P<0.05) in cell proliferation compared to the control animals. TNF-α production was suppressed (P<0.05) in the LAB12 group compared to the untreated mice. These results demonstrate that supplementation with LAB12 has immunomodulatory effects, under conditions of moderate physical exercise, which may have implications for human athletes. Further investigation in human trials is warranted to confirm and extrapolate these findings.",valid,

28121620,"The ventral hypothalamus (VHT) integrates several physiological cues to maintain glucose homeostasis and energy balance. Aging is associated with increased glucose intolerance but the underlying mechanisms responsible for age-related metabolic decline, including neuronal signaling in the VHT, remain elusive. We have shown that mice with VHT-targeted overexpression of ∆FosB, a splice variant of the AP1 transcription factor FosB, exhibit increased energy expenditure, leading to decreased adiposity. Here, we show that VHT-targeted overexpression of ∆FosB also improves glucose tolerance, increases insulin sensitivity in target organs and thereby suppresses insulin secretion. These effects are also observed by the overexpression of dominant negative JunD, demonstrating that they occur via AP1 antagonism within the VHT. Furthermore, the improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity persisted in aged animals overexpressing ∆FosB in the VHT. These beneficial effects on glucose metabolism were abolished by peripheral sympathectomy and α-adrenergic, but not β-adrenergic, blockade. Taken together, our results show that antagonizing AP1 transcription activity in the VHT leads to a marked improvement in whole body glucose homeostasis via activation of the SNS, conferring protection against age-related impairment in glucose metabolism. These findings may open novel avenues for therapeutic intervention in diabetes and age-related glucose intolerance.",valid,5361668

27973479,"We theoretically and numerically investigate the nonparaxial self-accelerating beams in a Λ-type three-level energy system of rubidium atomic vapor in the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) window. In the EIT window, the absorption of the atomic vapor is small, and robust nonparaxial self-accelerating beams can be generated. The reason is that the energy of the tail transfers to the main lobe, which then maintains its shape, owing to the self-healing effect. Media with large absorption would demand large energy to compensate, and the tail would be lifted too high to maintain the profile of an accelerating beam, so that self-accelerating beams cannot be obtained any longer. An atomic vapor with small absorption is the ideal medium to produce such self-accelerating beams and, in return, self-accelerating beams may inspire new ideas in the research associated with atomic vapors and atomic-like ensembles.",valid,

19800044,"Many studies have investigated mechanically induced bone formation in mice and rats by applying loads to the long bones, and measuring changes in periosteal cortical bone apposition rates. However, the results are difficult to compare among each other because the loading schemes are generally different. The purpose of the present study was to develop a theoretical framework for evaluating the mechanical stimulus based on the bone daily strain stimulus, which is a function of loading cycles and bone strains. The daily strain stimulus would act as a single unifying parameter for directly comparing data from existing in vivo experiments, and is applied here to twenty previous rat and mouse studies. To calculate the daily strain stimulus, we determined the periosteal daily strain stimulus necessary for bone maintenance (xi(peri,0)) and the strain-cycle weighting exponent (m). In the first approach, we applied data from Rubin and Lanyon's bone maintenance studies. We calculated xi(peri,0) to be 2793 microstrain/day, and m to be 4.5. In the second approach, we used Fritton et al. 's strain gage recordings to calculate xi(peri,0) to be 1496 microstrain/day, and used an m value of 11.88, equal to human bone compressive fatigue properties. Fatigue data provided physiological relevance, and was useful for applying an established remodeling theory to in vivo studies. For both approaches, xi(peri,0) was below the fracture level. We then analyzed the applied strains, cycles, and periosteal bone apposition rates from the previous studies. The range of daily strain stimuli calculated using the first approach was much larger than the range using the second approach (2793-17312 microstrain/day compared to 1496-7681 microstrain/day). None of the studies applied a daily strain stimulus above the complete fatigue failure level, but some studies applied loading that could result in major fatigue microdamage. Bone apposition rates generally increased with increasing daily strain stimulus, which was consistent with previous theoretical models. The results suggest that the daily strain stimulus may be a reasonable first approximation for predicting bone apposition rates in a consistent manner. The use of the daily strain stimulus may be helpful for improving the design of future bone loading studies.",valid,

Recent efforts have identified patterns of activity in visual regions that contain information about items being held in WM. However, it remains unclear (1) whether these representations withstand intervening sensory input and (2) how communication between multimodal association cortex and the unimodal perceptual regions supporting WM representations is involved in WM storage. We present evidence that the features of a face held in WM are stored within face-processing regions, that these representations persist across subsequent sensory input, and that information about the match between sensory input and a memory representation is relayed forward from perceptual to prefrontal regions. Participants were presented with a series of probe faces and indicated whether each probe matched a target face held in WM. We parametrically varied the feature similarity between the probe and target faces. Activity within face-processing regions scaled linearly with the degree of feature similarity between the probe face and the features of the target face, suggesting that the features of the target face were stored in these regions. Furthermore, directed connectivity measures revealed that the direction of information flow that was optimal for performance was from sensory regions that stored the features of the target face to dorsal prefrontal regions, supporting the notion that sensory input is compared to representations stored within perceptual regions and is subsequently relayed forward. Together, these findings indicate that WM storage operations are carried out within perceptual cortex.",valid,4362687

The developmental importance of the P0 protein in PNS myelination has been dramatically demonstrated by the analysis of loss-of-function mutations engineered through the expression of antisense RNA and through the insertional inactivation of the P0 gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells and the generation of P0-deficient mice. The cloned promoter of the P0 gene has been shown to drive quantitative, Schwann cell-specific expression of heterologous genes in transgenic mice. The PMP22/gas3 gene, previously cloned from fibroblast cell lines, has been found to encode an axonally regulated Schwann cell protein that is assembled into PNS myelin.

However, preference for the risky option has been shown to increase under conditions where informative stimuli signaling the outcome of a risky choice is included between the choice and the outcome and this risk-prone preference persists even when the risky option has a lower expected value than the alternative safe option. In the present study, rhesus macaques chose between a risky option and a safe option across two experimental phases to determine whether the outcome signal affected the degree of preference for the risky option. Overall, six out of seven macaques showed a greater preference for the risky option in the signaled condition than in the unsignaled condition. The macaques' risky choices were sensitive to the expected value of the risky option and the signaled condition produced a general increase in risky choices independently of the expected value of the risky outcome.

Aside from predicting a flexible window setting for each raw image, we statistically identify the top four window settings by calculating the mean and standard deviations for the entire dataset. Images are scaled on each of the top settings estimated by WEM and following lesion classifiers are subsequently trained. We study the effects of only using the flexible window, the single fixed window as either a known default window used by radiologists or an estimated mean value, and two different approaches to combine results from the top window settings to improve the detection of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) from brain CT images.

Dose-response and time course experiments were performed in phenobarbitone treated male DBA/2Ha mice to study the pathogenesis of this unusual cocaine induced lesion. An increase in the dose of cocaine from 60 to 90 or 120 mg/kg produced more extensive and severe periportal and linking portal damage and elevated plasma aspartate (AST) and alanine (ALT) aminotransferases in a dose dependent manner. Scattered hepatocyte degeneration began at the edge of the periportal region and was detectable by electron microscopy within 30 minutes of administration of 60 mg/kg of cocaine, with conspicuous disorganization of the endoplasmic reticulum being one of the earliest changes. Significant elevations of plasma AST and ALT were observed 3 hours after cocaine administration and were sustained for 12 hours, at which time progressive hepatocyte damage had developed into a network of confluent necrosis at the periphery of the periportal region. The rapidity of organelle derangement and subsequent cell death, and absence of any effect on total cytochrome P-450 or FAD-mono-oxygenase levels, appear to distinguish this periportal lesion from previous reports of cocaine induced centrilobular necrosis in non-enzyme induced mice, suggesting that the two types of damage may develop by different mechanisms.

36274434,"Angiostrongylus vasorum is a widely distributed cardiopulmonary parasite of canids in Europe. Clinical signs in dogs can be highly variable and diagnostically challenging. A correct and early diagnosis is hence indispensable to adequately manage affected patients. First-stage larvae (L1) are excreted in the faeces of definitive hosts and conventionally identified using the Baermann technique. Moreover, ELISAs for the detection of circulating antigen and specific antibodies have been presented. The current study aimed at i) quantitatively assessing larval migration in the Baermann funnel after 12 h and 24 h; ii) investigating the influence of sample storage at 4 °C over the course of three days on the number of detected L1; iii) evaluating potential associations of adult worm burdens with larval shedding in dogs and ELISA optical density (OD) values for circulating parasite antigen and specific antibodies. Faecal samples were obtained from naturally infected dogs (n = 21) and Baermann funnels were set up in duplicate over the course of four consecutive days (days 0-3) starting with the day of sample collection. Funnels were harvested on days 1-4 after 12 and 24 h, respectively, and the number of L1 per gram faeces (LPG) was determined. The LPG did not differ between larval harvest after 12 h from harvest after 24 h. Storage of faecal samples at 4 °C for two and three days entailed a considerable decrease in LPG. Adult worm burdens and larval excretion data from previous experiments demonstrated a correlation between worm burden and LPG. In contrast, no correlations between worm burden and the level of parasite antigen and specific antibody OD values, respectively, were identified. Thus, OD values of both antigen and antibody ELISA did not allow for conclusions on infection intensity reflected by the number of adult parasites. For the detection of L1 in faeces, 12 or 24 h of larval migration time was not discriminating for A. vasorum positivity. Thus, early processing of faecal samples is essential, since larval detection and hence sensitivity of the approach considerably decreased over the course of three days of storage. Therefore, the common recommendation to collect faecal samples for three consecutive days and to subsequently analyse them needs to be reconsidered. The results of this study can be readily translated into precise recommendations for daily practice to adequately assess A. vasorum infected dogs.",valid,
8149827,"Close relationships between agriculture and many areas of human activity determine countless interlinkages with global issues of natural environment protection, human population increase, food supply, industry and world trade.

Elsewhere the main concerns is to maintain a trend of increasing production: food security with a future dimension. Achieving this depends essentially on protecting the agricultural resource base. Inputs and input substitution are important co-related issues but the core of sustainability is the avoidance of any attrition of the potential for future production; this demands that we guard soil, water sources, grazing lands and gene pools against loss and degradation. Though superficially biophysical or technical in nature, most problems of resource degradation and eroding potential are rooted in economic, social and political issues; few such problems will be solved unless the primacy of these issues is recognized and addressed.

Immunocytochemistry and cell counting were used to evaluate the numbers of surviving neurons and their expression of galanin and VIP. To reflect the in vivo situation, cryostat sections of porcine mid-jejunum were used. A concentration-dependent and marked increase in neuronal survival was noted when neurons were grown in the presence of VIP (10(-8)-10(-6) M), whereas addition of galanin (10(-8)-10(-6) M) slightly decreased neuronal survival. A dramatic increase in the proportions of myenteric neurons containing VIP or galanin immunoreactivity occurred during culturing. The presence of VIP further increased the number of galanin-expressing neurons. A majority of the galanin-immunoreactive neurons lacked VIP, while all VIP-immunoreactive neurons contained galanin. In conclusion, culturing porcine myenteric neurons in the presence of VIP increases, while the presence of galanin reduces, survival.

This longitudinal clinical information was reported to the North American Home Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Registry (Oley Foundation/A.S.P.E.N. joint project) between 1985 and 1989. The data shows that the number of active cancer patients on this therapy is increasing 13% per year. The annual survival rate is 25% for patients with active cancer, as compared with 88% for patients with radiation enteritis and 95% for patients with Crohn's disease. Although 50% of all active cancer patients starting HPN are dead within 6 to 9 months, the prognosis is somewhat better in children, and 20% of these active cancer patients appear to do well, returning to full oral nutrition and experiencing complete rehabilitation. These are presumed to be patients with a potentially curable cancer requiring super-aggressive treatment, which causes temporary severe gastrointestinal dysfunction. Adult active cancer patients have the same rehospitalization rate for HPN complications (once per year) as radiation enteritis and Crohn's disease patients. However, their rehospitalization rate for non-HPN complications is four times higher.

19009585,"Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data are often analysed by mixed-effects modelling techniques (also known as population analysis), which has become a standard tool in the pharmaceutical industries for drug development. The last 10 years has witnessed considerable interest in the application of experimental design theories to population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic experiments. Design of population pharmacokinetic experiments involves selection and a careful balance of a number of design factors. Optimal design theory uses prior information about the model and parameter estimates to optimize a function of the Fisher information matrix to obtain the best combination of the design factors. This paper provides a review of the different approaches that have been described in the literature for optimal design of population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic experiments. It describes options that are available and highlights some of the issues that could be of concern as regards practical application. It also discusses areas of application of optimal design theories in clinical pharmacology experiments. It is expected that as the awareness about the benefits of this approach increases, more people will embrace it and ultimately will lead to more efficient population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic experiments and can also help to reduce both cost and time during drug development.",valid,

A major impediment for accurate measurements of microplastics in environmental matrixes is to extract the particles. The most commonly-used method for separation from soil or sediment is flotation in dense liquid based on the relatively low density of plastic particles. This study provides an improved and optimized process for extraction of microplastic particles by modifying the floatation technique and floatation solution. Microplastics in soils and sediments are extracted by adding 200 g dry soil or sediment sample to 1.3 L mix of the saturated NaCl and NaI solutions in a volume ratio of 1:1 and aerating for 40 s then filtering the supernatant. The accuracy and precision of the new approach is validated by recovery experiments using soil and sediment samples spiked with six common microplastic compounds: polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS) and expanded polystyrene (EPS), and comparison with the previous method.

Ideally, fermentation feedstocks would rather rely on industrial waste streams than on food-based raw materials. Corynebacterium glutamicum was metabolically engineered to produce the bio-nylon precursor 1,5-diaminopentane from the hemicellulose sugar xylose. Comparison of a basic diaminopentane producer strain on xylose and glucose feedstocks revealed a 30% reduction in diaminopentane yield and productivity on the pentose sugar. The integration of in vivo and in silico metabolic flux analysis by (13) C and elementary modes identified bottlenecks in the pentose phosphate pathway and the tricarboxylic acid cycle that limited performance on xylose. By the integration of global transcriptome profiling, this could be specifically targeted to the tkt operon, genes that encode for fructose bisphosphatase (fbp) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (icd), and to genes involved in formation of lysine (lysE) and N-acetyl diaminopentane (act).

8426849,"A sixfold difference in resistance to coccidia (Eimeria tenella) infection between a resistant and a susceptible line of Auburn White Leghorn chickens, derived by selective breeding, has been reported. The purpose of the following study was to determine whether the resistance or susceptibility phenomenon in the Auburn lines could be manifested in a homogeneous group of isolated host kidney cells that support E. tenella development in vitro but not normally in vivo. Propagation of the parasite in host cells in vitro eliminates humoral and cellular elements of immunity, and allows the study of host genetic influences at the cellular level. Differences in parasite development were examined between the two lines of cells in vitro after 48 and 96 h of incubation; time periods that reflect initial infection of the host cells by the parasite and the subsequent asexual development. Quantification of differences by liquid scintillation counting was based on parasite-specific incorporation of pyrimidines, specifically [3H]-uracil. The results supported previous findings that overall E. tenella development was significantly greater in the host cells from the susceptible line than in the cells from the resistant cultures at both time periods.",valid,

32364395,"Ischemic heart disease, especially myocardial infarction (MI), is the leading cause of death worldwide. Apoptotic mechanisms are thought to play a significant role in cardiomyocyte death after MI. Increased production of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in cardiomyocytes is a normal response to promote tolerance and to reduce cell damage. Hsp27 is considered to be a therapeutic option for the treatment of ischemic heart disease due to its protective effects on hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Despite its antiapoptotic effects, the lack of strategies to deliver Hsp27 to the heart tissue in vivo limits its clinical applicability. In this study, we utilized an antibody against the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, which is expressed immediately after ischemia/reperfusion in the heart of MI rats. To achieve cardiomyocyte-targeted Hsp27 delivery after ischemia/reperfusion, we employed the immunoglobulin-binding dimer ZZ, a modified domain of protein A, in conjunction with the AT1 receptor antibody. Using the AT1 receptor antibody, we achieved systemic delivery of ZZ-TAT-GFP fusion protein into the heart of MI rats. This approach enabled selective delivery of Hsp27 to cardiomyocytes, rescued cells from apoptosis, reduced the area of fibrosis, and improved cardiac function in the rat MI model, thus suggesting its applicability as a cardiomyocyte-targeted protein delivery system to inhibit apoptosis induced by ischemic injury.",valid,
16969133,"When quiescent cells are stimulated to reenter the cell cycle, growth factors are required only until the restriction point in G(1) phase. After this point the cell no longer requires growth factors, proliferative signaling molecules, or even protein synthesis in order to initiate DNA synthesis, which starts several hours later. Consequently, understanding the molecular nature of the restriction point constitutes one of the major goals in studies of growth regulation. We recently demonstrated that p27Kip1 (p27) regulates passage through G(1) phase in actively proliferating cultures, and initiated these studies to determine if it is also involved in passage through the restriction point following stimulation of quiescent cells. In support of this suggestion, we found that passage through the restriction point requires mitogen-dependent suppression of the high p27 levels normally present in quiescent cells. Moreover, as the culture progresses to mid-G(1) phase, the proportion of cells that pass the restriction point is increased by artificial suppression of p27 levels, while this proportion is reduced by elevation of p27 levels. p27 performs this critical function by regulating the subsequent activating phosphorylation of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK)2, which we also show is necessary for and closely associated with the initiation of DNA synthesis. We conclude that the p27 expression level at mid-G(1) phase determines when a cell passes through the restriction point, and does so by regulating subsequent CDK2 activation.",valid,

As such, monitoring the levels of nutrients and O(2) available to the cells is essential to assess the physiology of the cells and to evaluate strategies aiming at improving nutrient availability. In this article, a reporter system containing the luciferase gene driven by a hypoxia responsive promoter was used to monitor cellular hypoxia in a TE context. We report that luciferase activity correlates with the O(2) tension in the cell culture medium. When transgenic cells were seeded onto scaffolds and implanted in immune-deficient mice subcutaneously, luciferase activity was detected. To validate the response to O(2) levels of this reporter system, we cultured transgenic cells on biomaterials in a flow perfusion bioreactor and observed that cells in the bioreactor displayed a drastically lower luciferase activity than conventional static culture, and that higher luciferase activity is observed in the interior of a tissue-engineered construct, illustrating the uneven O(2) distribution in three-dimensional constructs under conventional static culture.

19348010,"Hirsutellin (HtA) is intermediate in size between other ribotoxins and less specific microbial RNases, and thus offers a unique chance to determine the minimal structural requirements for activities unique to ribotoxins. Here, we have determined the structure of HtA by NMR methods. The structure consists of one alpha-helix, a helical turn and seven beta-strands that form an N-terminal hairpin and an anti-parallel beta-sheet, with a characteristic alpha + beta fold and a highly positive charged surface. Compared to its larger homolog alpha-sarcin, the N-terminal hairpin is shorter and less positively charged. The secondary structure elements are connected by large loops with root mean square deviation (rmsd) values > 1 A, suggesting some degree of intrinsically dynamic behavior. The active site architecture of HtA is unique among ribotoxins. Compared to alpha-sarcin, HtA has an aspartate group, D40, replacing a tyrosine, and the aromatic ring of F126, located in the leucine 'environment' close to the catalytic H113 in a similar arrangement to that found in RNase T1. This unique active site structure is discussed in terms of its novel electrostatic interactions to understand the efficient cytotoxic activity of HtA. The contributions of the N-terminal hairpin, loop 2 and loop 5 with regard to protein functionality, protein-protein and protein-ipid interactions, are also discussed. The truncation and reduced charge of the N-terminal hairpin in HtA may be compensated for by the extension and new orientation of its loop 5. This novel orientation of loop 5 re-establishes a positive charge on the side of the molecule that has been shown to be important for intermolecular interactions in ribotoxins.",valid,

The isolation of facultative and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, fungi, and gram-positive cocci (except viridans streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis) almost always indicated true bacteremia, whereas the isolation of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacilli, including Clostridium species, often represented contamination. More than 99% of all episodes were detected when two samples of blood (a total of 30 ml) were cultured. The five most common isolates were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The incidence of septicemia was highest among medical patients and lowest among obstetric-gynecologic patients. Two-thirds of all episodes were nosocomial; S. aureus, enterococci, facultative gram-negative bacilli, and fungi were especially common nosocomial pathogens. The microorganisms isolated varied with the hospital service; polymicrobial episodes were especially common among surgical patients and transplant recipients. The most common sources of bacteremia were the respiratory, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tracts; however, the source was unknown in nearly one-third of episodes. Microorganisms causing septicemia in neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients were not different; however, polymicrobial infections were more frequent in the presence of neutropenia.

21796121,"Severe behavioural deficits in psychiatric diseases such as autism and schizophrenia have been hypothesized to arise from elevations in the cellular balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) within neural microcircuitry. This hypothesis could unify diverse streams of pathophysiological and genetic evidence, but has not been susceptible to direct testing. Here we design and use several novel optogenetic tools to causally investigate the cellular E/I balance hypothesis in freely moving mammals, and explore the associated circuit physiology. Elevation, but not reduction, of cellular E/I balance within the mouse medial prefrontal cortex was found to elicit a profound impairment in cellular information processing, associated with specific behavioural impairments and increased high-frequency power in the 30-80 Hz range, which have both been observed in clinical conditions in humans. Consistent with the E/I balance hypothesis, compensatory elevation of inhibitory cell excitability partially rescued social deficits caused by E/I balance elevation.

31557959,"Current satellite remote sensing data still have some inevitable defects, such as a low observing frequency, high cost and dense cloud cover, which limit the rapid response to ground changes and many potential applications. However, passenger aircraft may be an alternative remote sensing platform in emergency response due to the high revisit rate, dense coverage and low cost. This paper introduces a volunteered passenger aircraft remote sensing method (VPARS) for emergency response. It uses the images captured by the passenger volunteers during flight. Based on computer vision algorithms and geocoding procedures, these images can be processed into a mosaic orthoimage for rapid ground disaster mapping. Notable, due to the relatively low flight latitude, small clouds can be easily removed by stacking multi-angle tilt images in the VPARS method. A case study on the 2019 Guangdong flood monitoring validates these advantages. The frequent aircraft revisit time, intensive flight coverage, multi-angle images and low cost of the VPARS make it a potential way to complement traditional remote sensing methods in emergency response.",valid,6806073
3651230,"In four experiments we reexamined the recent report by Labbe, Firl, Mufson, and Stein (1983) that fetal cortical tissue transplanted to an aspirative prefrontal cortical cavity in rats can ameliorate the learning impairments induced by the aspirative lesions. Healthy surviving grafts from young (E16) embryonic donors had no immediate effects on the rats' impairments in T-maze alternation, spatial navigation in the Morris swimming pool task, or locomotor activity, and they produced even greater impairments than the lesions alone when all three tests were conducted after longer (3-5 month) survival periods. Grafts taken from older (E21) donors did produce a short-lasting improvement in the T-maze alternation performance, replicating the previous report. However, this effect was not seen in the other two behavioral tests; the grafts survived poorly, and the beneficial effect was no longer apparent in the long-term tests. It is concluded that (a) functional benefits of embryonic cortical grafts are dependent on a precise combination of conditions rather than being a general phenomenon, and (b) the short-lasting recovery in delayed alternation performance is attributable to diffuse influences of the embryonic tissue on the lesioned host brain rather than to a reconnection of damaged circuitries.",valid,

Although 94% of the women said they had used some contraceptive method at some time, 23% were not currently practicing contraception. Both nonuse and the use of less effective methods appear to be caused by method-related fears, dislike of available methods, and a general negative feeling about contraception. Less effective methods may be avoided because women view them as offering less protection and dislike their coitus-dependent qualities. Structural or provider-related concerns, such as cost, were seldom reported as barriers to contraceptive use. The primary barrier to clinic use is the apparent belief of many women that clinics do not offer personalized care and provide lower quality care than private physicians.

15804605,"Newly synthesized polypeptides entering the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) encounter a large array of molecular chaperones and folding factors that facilitate proper folding as well as assess folding status, retaining non-native proteins within the ER. Calnexin (CNX), an ER membrane protein, and its soluble homologue, calreticulin (CRT), are two important molecular chaperones that contribute to both processes. They are highly unusual chaperones in that they act as lectins, binding the Asn-linked oligosaccharides of newly synthesized glycoproteins, as well as recognizing the polypeptide segments of glycoproteins. Furthermore, they associate with ERp57, a thiol oxidoreductase, that is thought to enhance the oxidative folding of glycoproteins bound to CNX/CRT. These characteristics of CNX and CRT as well as their mode of action have been elucidated though the use of multiple in vitro and in vivo approaches. This chapter will focus on the description of a number of in vitro assays that have been used to characterize the lectin and ERp57-binding functions of CNX/CRT and also their abilities to act as molecular chaperones to suppress protein aggregation. In addition, we will describe insect and mammalian expression systems in which major histocompatibility complex class I molecules are used as model glycoprotein substrates for CNX and CRT.

We report the effects of poloxamer 407 (Pluronic F-127) on plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in rats. Poloxamer 407 injected into rats by intraperitoneal injection (dose = 1.5 gm/kg) resulted in sustained (greater than 96 hour) hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. A larger dose of poloxamer 407 was required to elevate plasma triglyceride relative to total cholesterol. Ingestion of commercial rat chow had a negligible effect on plasma cholesterol and triglycerides levels in control (no poloxamer injection) animals, but consumption of food by animals that received an intraperitoneal injection of poloxamer 407 (30% w/w) resulted in significantly (p < .05) greater elevations in plasma cholesterol and triglycerides than in fasted animals administered poloxamer 407. The route of poloxamer 407 administration, namely intramuscular vs. intraperitoneal injection, was observed to be a more important factor for poloxamer-induced elevations in plasma cholesterol than poloxamer-mediated elevations in plasma triglycerides. Our results also provide suggestive evidence that the mechanism responsible for the elevation of plasma cholesterol following intraperitoneal injection of a poloxamer 407 solution (30% w/w) to rats may be due to stimulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity in the liver by the poloxamer vehicle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",valid,

The major current problem in upper abdominal MR imaging is physiologic motions, and this appears to have been effectively solved by newly introduced pulse-sequence and timing-parameter strategies. Short-TR/TE spin-echo sequences with extensive signal averaging and heavy T1-weighting produce images with exceptional anatomic detail and liver-cancer contrast differences. With this sequence superior sensitivity for liver-cancer detection has been shown in quantitative signal-difference to noise comparisons with other pulse sequences and in clinical comparisons with CT. MR discovered 14% more individual metastases and 3% more patients with liver cancer than CT in a blinded comparative study of 142 patients undergoing both exams. MR also showed greater specificity (98%) than CT (91%) in distinguishing patients without liver metastases. Differentiation of hemangioma from metastases was possible with greater than 90% specificity by using heavily T2-weighted sequences. Use of a fast-scan, gradient-recalled echo technique can also produce good-quality, multislice, T1-weighted studies of the liver in 20 sec--a breath-hold.

Certain preclinical pharmacology studies have focused on STAT3 phosphorylation and homodimerization, and have developed a class of salicylic acid-based inhibitors, which blocks the nuclear translocation-dependent canonical STAT3 signaling. In the present study, we demonstrated that the salicylic acid-based compound SH-4-54 was quite toxic to temozolomide (TMZ)-resistant GBM cells and could trigger apoptosis in these cells via enhancing mitochondrial translocation-dependent non-canonical STAT3 pathway. We demonstrated that incubation of TMZ-resistant GBM cells with SH-4-54 led to mitochondrial STAT3 (mitoSTAT3) activation and respiratory dysfunction reflected by disrupted (or suppressed) activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes and oxygen consumption rate. Mechanistically, we proved that SH-4-54 could increase mitoSTAT3 transmembrane import via GRIM-19 and reinforce the association between mitoSTAT3 and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), indicating that SH-4-54 could facilitate the binding of mitoSTAT3 to mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) and negatively regulate mitochondrial-encoded genes, thus leading to the abnormal oxidation respiratory. Lastly, using GRIM-19 knockout cell line and subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model, we elaborately showed the enrichment of SH-4-54 in mitochondria by LC-MS/MS analysis.

We compared rates of gene flow across old-growth (Olympic National Park) and logged landscapes (Olympic National Forest) and used spatial autoregression to estimate the effect of landscape variables on genetic structure. We detected higher overall genetic connectivity across the managed forest, although this was likely a historical signature of continuous forest before timber harvest began. Gene flow also occurred terrestrially, as connectivity was high across unconnected river basins. Autoregressive models demonstrated that closed forest and low solar radiation were correlated with increased gene flow. In addition, there was evidence for a temporal lag in the correlation of decreased gene flow with harvest, suggesting that the full genetic impact may not appear for several generations. Furthermore, we detected genetic evidence of population bottlenecks across the Olympic National Forest, including at sites that were within old-growth forest but surrounded by harvested patches. Collectively, this research suggests that absence of forest (whether due to natural or anthropogenic changes) is a key restrictor of genetic connectivity and that intact forested patches in the surrounding environment are necessary for continued gene flow and population connectivity.",valid,

12179930,"This article analyzes the effects on Hmong women of a Laotian government policy to replace production of opium by upland farmers with other cash crops by the year 2000. In 1996, 15% of the population relied on opium as a cash crop. This project aimed to include Hmong women in small livestock production in 2 villages: Ban Kampanien and Ban Pha Ven in Nong Het district, Xieng Khouang province, near the Vietnamese border. Interviews were conducted among 33 families using the Harvard Gender Analytical Tools (1991) to determine gender roles in livestock production. Participatory assessment relied on matrix ranking, resource maps, and trend charts. In Nong Het, White Hmong dominate. Average family size is 7 persons. Polygamy is allowed, but declining. The birthrate is high. Swidden agriculture is practiced. Agricultural production meets demand. Patriarchal authority dominates; men and women have separate public and private spheres. Education favors boys. Women are involved in all aspects of agricultural production. The author describes women's role in small livestock production and gender roles in feed management. Women exercise autonomy only through raising livestock and poultry. Women's production is constrained by limited access to extension services, feed resources, labor saving technology, and credit. In order to offset the loss of income from opium, Hmong women need to increase their income by increasing the product output per animal using selective breeding, and decreasing time spent on preparing and processing food. Assistance should be provided to improve women's resources and knowledge.",valid,
19837191,"Magnesium (Mg) alloys are promising materials for the development of biodegradable implants. However, the current in vitro test procedures for cytotoxicity, cell viability and proliferation are not always suitable for this class of materials. In this paper we show that tetrazolium-salt-based assays, which are widely used in practice, are influenced by the corrosion products of Mg-based alloys. Corroded Mg converts tetrazolium salts to formazan, leading to a higher background and falsifying the results of cell viability. Tetrazolium-based assays are therefore not a useful tool for testing the cytotoxicity of Mg in static in vitro assays.",valid,
37813167,"Amongst other molecules, the cholinergic system consists of choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT, - synthesis enzyme), acetylcholinesterase (AChE - primary hydrolysis enzyme), and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE - secondary hydrolysis enzyme). In the brainstem, the Dorsal Motor Nucleus of The Vagus (DMNV) has high cholinergic expression and is a region of interest in the neuropathology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is the unexpected death of a seemingly healthy infant, but postmortem brainstem abnormalities suggesting altered cholinergic regulation have been found. This study aimed to determine the percentage of positive ChAT and AChE neurons within the infant DMNV through immunohistochemistry at the three levels of the brainstem medulla (caudal, intermediate, and rostral), to investigate whether the proportion of neurons positive for these enzymes differs amongst the diagnostic subgroups of SIDS compared to those with an explained cause of Sudden unexpected death in infancy (eSUDI), and whether there were any associations with SIDS risk factors (male gender, cigarette smoke exposure, co-sleeping/bed sharing, and prone sleeping). Results showed that ChAT-positive neurons were lower in the rostral DMNV in the SIDS II cohort, and within the caudal and intermediate DMNV of infants who were exposed to cigarette smoke. These findings suggest altered cholinergic regulation in the brainstem of SIDS infants, with potential contribution of cigarette smoke exposure, presumably via the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor system.",valid,

28134287,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) are defined by their dual ability to self-renew through mitotic cell division or differentiate into the varied neural cell types of the CNS. DISP3/PTCHD2 is a sterol-sensing domain-containing protein, highly expressed in neural tissues, whose expression is regulated by thyroid hormone. In the present study, we used a mouse NSC line to investigate what effect DISP3 may have on the self-renewal and/or differentiation potential of the cells. We demonstrated that NSC differentiation triggered significant reduction in DISP3 expression in the resulting astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes. Moreover, when DISP3 expression was disrupted, the NSC ""stemness"" was suppressed, leading to a larger population of cells undergoing spontaneous neuronal differentiation. Conversely, overexpression of DISP3 resulted in increased NSC proliferation. When NSCs were cultured under differentiation conditions, we observed that the lack of DISP3 augmented the number of NSCs differentiating into each of the neural cell lineages and that neuronal morphology was altered. In contrast, DISP3 overexpression resulted in impaired cell differentiation. Taken together, our findings imply that DISP3 may help dictate the NSC cell fate to either undergo self-renewal or switch to the terminal differentiation cell program.",valid,5278513

Cryoglobulins were detected on admission in 36 of 100 patients and appeared during observation in a further 18 cases. Cryocrit ranged from 0.5% to 20%. Patients with MC were older and had a higher incidence of cirrhosis than those without MC. Immunologic characterization of the cryoprecipitate showed the presence of type II in 84% of cases and type III in 16%. The patients received IFN-alpha (6 MU three times per week) for 6 months. Fifty-seven were responders (i.e., reached normal aminotransferase levels), 26 of these relapsed within 2 months after IFN withdrawal, and 30 did not relapse. After IFN-alpha treatment, cryoglobulinemia disappeared in 11 of the 21 evaluable responders, but in none of the 15 nonresponder patients (p < 0.003). The clearance of MC was associated in all cases with clearance of HCV RNA.

Three strains of S. mansoni were used: BH2, adapted to B. glabrata, and SJ and SJ2 adapted to B. tenagophila. None of the 543 snails exposed to the BH2 strain became infected, nor did any of the 668 exposed to SJ. However, of the 500 exposed the SJ2, 4 of the 163 snails (2%) from Ayolas, a locality in the Paraná basin, were susceptible, as were 8 of 45 (18%) from Fuente, Salto, in the Uruguay basin. These findings are similar to those of studies done in other geographic areas, where some populations of B. tenagophila do not become infected with S. mansoni while others are susceptible.

24850902,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) arises at the convergence of genetic alterations in KRAS with a fostering microenvironment shaped by immune cell influx and fibrotic changes; identification of the earliest tumorigenic molecular mediators evokes the proverbial chicken and egg problem. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are key drivers of tumor progression that originate primarily from stromal cells activated by the developing tumor. Here, MMP3, known to be expressed in PDA, was found to be associated with expression of Rac1b, a tumorigenic splice isoform of Rac1, in all stages of pancreatic cancer. Using a large cohort of human PDA tissue biopsies specimens, both MMP3 and Rac1b are expressed in PDA cells, that the expression levels of the two markers are highly correlated, and that the subcellular distribution of Rac1b in PDA is significantly associated with patient outcome. Using transgenic mouse models, coexpression of MMP3 with activated KRAS in pancreatic acinar cells stimulates metaplasia and immune cell infiltration, priming the stromal microenvironment for early tumor development. Finally, exposure of cultured pancreatic cancer cells to recombinant MMP3 stimulates expression of Rac1b, increases cellular invasiveness, and activation of tumorigenic transcriptional profiles.",valid,4201965
17346684,"Evidence suggests that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) is a leading cause of dopaminergic neuronal cell death. TNF also, however, has neuroprotective effects. Thus, TNF might have a dual role following injury: immediate release after injury is protective, whereas chronic increases are detrimental. In the present study, 6-hydroxydopamine was used to lesion the dorsal striatum in male Fisher 344 rats at 2 different time points. Group 1 received a daily injection of TNFalpha antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ODN) or control on days 1 through 7 post-lesion. Group 2 received a daily injection of TNF antisense ODN or control on days 5 through 15 post-lesion. Rats were killed on the day following the last injection of TNF antisense ODN. Injection of TNF antisense ODN on days 1 through 7 increased the area of the tyrosine-hydroxylase-negative zone ipsilateral to the injection when compared to controls. In contrast, when inhibition of TNF was delayed, the area of tyrosine hydroxylase loss was significantly reduced. These findings suggest that TNF release is neuroprotective in the early stages of injury but becomes neurotoxic when chronically induced.",valid,

28109669,"Schizophrenia displays connectivity deficits in the brain, but the literature has shown inconsistent findings about alterations in global efficiency of brain functional networks. We supposed that such inconsistency at the whole brain level may be due to a mixture of different portions of global efficiency at sub-brain levels. Accordingly, we considered measuring portions of global efficiency in two aspects: spatial portions by considering sub-brain networks and topological portions by considering contributions to global efficiency according to direct and indirect topological connections. We proposed adjacency and indirect adjacency as new network parameters attributable to direct and indirect topological connections, respectively, and applied them to graph-theoretical analysis of brain functional networks constructed from resting state fMRI data of 22 patients with schizophrenia and 22 healthy controls. Group differences in the network parameters were observed not for whole brain and hemispheric networks, but for regional networks. Alterations in adjacency and indirect adjacency were in opposite directions, such that adjacency increased, but indirect adjacency decreased in patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, over connections in frontal and parietal regions, increased adjacency was associated with more severe negative symptoms, while decreased adjacency was associated with more severe positive symptoms of schizophrenia. This finding indicates that connectivity deficits associated with positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia may involve topologically different paths in the brain. In patients with schizophrenia, although changes in global efficiency may not be clearly shown, different alterations in brain functional networks according to direct and indirect topological connections could be revealed at the regional level.",valid,

We find that childhood infections are often highly correlated within individuals in early childhood, with the correlations persisting into adulthood only for infections sharing a transmission route. We discuss 2 applications of the methods: 1) to making inferences about routes of transmission when these are unknown or uncertain and 2) to estimating epidemiologic parameters such as the basic reproduction number and the critical immunization threshold. Two examples of such applications are presented: elucidating the transmission route of polyomaviruses BK and JC and estimating the basic reproduction number and critical immunization coverage of varicella-zoster infection in Belgium, Italy, Poland, and England and Wales.

Irs2 was mainly localized to the outer plexiform layer as well as to photoreceptor inner segments. It was also seen in ganglion cells and inner plexiform layer but in smaller amounts. Compared with control littermates, Irs2 knock-out mice lose 10% of their photoreceptors 1 week after birth and up to 50% by 2 weeks of age as a result of increased apoptosis. The surviving photoreceptor cells developed short organized segments, which displayed proportionally diminished but otherwise normal electrical function. However, IGF1-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was barely detected, and cleaved/activated caspase-3 was significantly elevated in isolated retinas of Irs2-/- mice. When diabetes was prevented, which allowed the Irs2-/- mice to survive for 2 years, most photoreceptor cells were lost by 16 months of age.

Because of their tolerance to aneuploidy, plants provide a powerful system for a genome-wide investigation of aneuploid syndromes, an approach that is not feasible in animal systems. Indeed, in many plant species, populations of aneuploid individuals can be easily obtained from triploid individuals. We phenotyped a population of Arabidopsis thaliana aneuploid individuals containing 25 different karyotypes. Even in this highly heterogeneous population, we demonstrate that certain traits are strongly associated with the dosage of specific chromosome types and that chromosomal effects can be additive. Further, we identified subtle developmental phenotypes expressed in the diploid progeny of aneuploid parent(s) but not in euploid controls from diploid lineages. These results indicate long-term phenotypic consequences of aneuploidy that can persist after chromosomal balance has been restored.

Photo-dehydrocyclization of the 3,6-bis-styryl derivative of carbazole leading to sterically less demanding aza[7]helicene resulted in smooth reaction, and only the desired angular-angular product was detected. However, in the case of aza[9]helicene, along with the expected angular-angular cyclization, three other products involving linear mode of cyclization were also isolated and characterized. In this case, the helical compound aza[9]helicene was predominantly formed at lower concentration while the other isomers were obtained at higher concentration. All of the compounds formed by angular-angular, angular-linear, and linear-linear modes of cyclization were fully characterized, and their photophysical properties were investigated.",valid,

Here, we compare the responses of the mouse Olfr73 ectopically expressed in olfactory sensory neurons using AAV gene delivery in vivo and expressed in vitro in cell culture. The response dynamics and concentration-dependence of agonists for the ectopically expressed Olfr73 were similar to those reported for the endogenous Olfr73, however the antagonism previously reported between its cognate agonist and several antagonists was not replicated in vivo. Expressing the OR in vitro reproduced the antagonism reported for short odor pulses, but not for prolonged odor exposure. Our findings suggest that both the cellular environment and the stimulus dynamics shape the functionality of Olfr73 and argue that characterizing ORs in 'native' conditions, rather than in vitro, provides a more relevant understanding of ligand-OR interactions.",valid,8085013

In this study, adsorption equilibrium and long term experiments were carried out to evaluate the performance of iron oxide coated sponge (IOCSp) in arsenic removal. It was found that maximum adsorption capacity of IOCSp for As(III) and As(V) calculated by Sips isotherm was 4.2 and 4.6 mg/g of IOCSp, respectively. A filter packed with small amount of 25 g IOCSp maintained a consistent arsenic removal efficiency of 95% from synthetic solution containing arsenic concentration of as high as 1000 microg/L. This produced a throughput volume of 153 and 178 L of water containing As(III) and As(V), respectively before any need for regeneration or disposal of IOCSp. IOCSp could be regenerated by washing it with NaOH solution. The dynamic (column) adsorption kinetics were successfully predicted by the Thomas and Nikolaidis modified models.",valid,
22617133,"Skin metastases occur in 0.6%-10.4% of all patients with cancer and represent 2% of all skin tumors. Skin metastases from visceral malignancies are important for dermatologists and dermatopathologists because of their variable clinical appearance and presentation, frequent delay and failure in their diagnosis, relative proportion of different internal malignancies metastasizing to the skin, and impact on morbidity, prognosis, and treatment. Another factor to take into account is that cutaneous metastasis may be the first sign of clinically silent visceral cancer. The relative frequencies of metastatic skin disease tend to correlate with the frequency of the different types of primary cancer in each sex. Thus, women with skin metastases have the following distribution in decreasing order of frequency of primary malignancies: breast, ovary, oral cavity, lung, and large intestine. In men, the distribution is as follows: lung, large intestine, oral cavity, kidney, breast, esophagus, pancreas, stomach, and liver. A wide morphologic spectrum of clinical appearances has been described in cutaneous metastases. This variable clinical morphology included nodules, papules, plaques, tumors, and ulcers. From a histopathologic point of view, there are 4 main morphologic patterns of cutaneous metastases involving the dermis, namely, nodular, infiltrative, diffuse, and intravascular. Generally, cutaneous metastases herald a poor prognosis. The average survival time of patients with skin metastases is a few months. In this article, we review the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of cutaneous metastases from internal malignancies, classify the most common cutaneous metastases, and identify studies that may assist in diagnosing the origin of a cutaneous metastasis.",valid,

Recently, the least cost path (LCP) calculation coupled with population genetic data and species distribution models has been applied to reveal the landscape connectivity. In this study, we utilized the categorical LCP method, combining species distribution of three periods (the last interglacial, the last glacial maximum, and the current period) and locality with shared chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear haplotypes, to identify the possible dispersal routes of T. dumosa in the late Quaternary. Then, both a coalescent estimate of migration rates among regional groups and establishment of genetic divergence pattern were conducted. After those analyses, we found that the species generally migrated along the southern slope of Himalaya across time periods and genomic makers, and higher degree of dispersal was in the present and mtDNA haplotype. Furthermore, the direction of range shifts and strong level of gene flow also imply the existence of Himalayan dispersal path, and low area of genetic divergence pattern suggests that there are not any obvious barriers against the dispersal pathway. Above all, we inferred that a dispersal route along the Himalaya Mountains could exist, which is an important supplement for the evolutionary history of T. dumosa.

Substantial challenges, however, remain in providing credible scientific information in a timely and efficient manner to support chemical risk assessment and management decisions. A major challenge confronting risk managers is the need for critical information to address risk uncertainties in large chemical inventories such as high- and medium-production-volume industrial chemicals or pesticide inert ingredients. From a strategic and tactical viewpoint, an integrated approach that relies on all existing knowledge and uses a range of methods, including those from emerging and novel technologies, is needed to advance progressive and focused testing strategies, as well as to advance the utility and predictability of the risk assessment by providing more relevant information. A hypothesis-based approach that draws on all relevant information is consistent with the vision articulated in the 2007 report by the National Research Council, Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy.

We first performed a quantitative, immunocytochemical study on the levels of CaM-Kinase II alpha expression in the frontal, parietal and occipital cortical areas of control adult rats. We found that the levels of expression of CaM-Kinase II alpha were larger in the frontal and parietal areas than in the occipital areas. In addition, all layer V neurons identified as projecting to the spinal cord were CaM-Kinase II alpha immunopositive. We then grafted embryonic day (E) 12 or 14 cells from the presumptive frontal or occipital cortex of donor fetuses into the frontal or occipital cortex of newborn hosts. Cortical cells grafted at E12 differentiate neurons with molecular (CaM-Kinase II alpha) and connectivity (spinal cord projection) phenotypes appropriate to the cortical area where they complete their development whereas cells taken at E14 differentiate neurons with molecular and connectivity phenotypes appropriate to their cortical locus of origin. These findings suggest that E12 progenitors destined to generate layer V neurons are multipotent. The final phenotype of their progeny depends on regionalizing signals expressed in the environment. Later in corticogenesis, committed progenitors become unable to respond to regionalizing signals and generate neurons whose phenotype is appropriate to the initial cortical position of the precursor.",valid,

26579583,"Comprehensive multiphase NMR is a novel NMR technique that permits all components (solutions, gels, and solids) to be studied in unaltered natural samples. In this study a wide range of CMP-NMR interaction and editing-based experiments are combined to follow contaminants (pentafluorophenol (PFP) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)) from the solution state (after a spill) through the gel-state and finally into the true solid-state (sequestered) in an intact water-swollen soil. Kinetics experiments monitoring each phase illustrate PFOA rapidly transfers from solution to the solid phase while for PFP the process is slower with longer residence times in the solution and gel phase. Interaction-based experiments reveal that PFOA enters the soil via its hydrophobic tails and selectively binds to soil microbial protein. PFP sorption shows less specificity exhibiting interactions with a range of gel and solid soil components with a preference toward aromatics (mainly lignin). The results indicate that in addition to more traditional measurements such as Koc, other factors including the influence of the contaminant on the soil-water interface, specific biological interactions, soil composition (content of lignin, protein, etc.) and physical accessibility/swellability of soil organic components will likely be central to better explaining and predicting the true behavior of contaminants in soil.",valid,
9506849,"Glycosaminoglycans regulate angiogenesis by affecting the availability of different growth factors for the endothelial cell (EC). However, little is known about the molecular and functional consequences resulting from direct interaction of these polyelectrolytes with the EC. Here we show that heparin markedly inhibited serum-stimulated DNA synthesis and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) mRNA expression in human endothelial cells (HEC). About 50% of the serum effect on DNA synthesis and ODC gene expression was prevented by the selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine or by PKC down-regulation. Heparin was ineffective in counteracting that part of the effect of serum that was resistant to PKC inhibition or down-regulation. In serum-free cultured HEC, heparin completely abolished the increase in DNA synthesis and ODC mRNA expression elicited by a number of PKC activators. Cell exposure to difluoromethylornithine, an irreversible inhibitor of ODC enzyme, dramatically antagonised both serum- and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated DNA synthesis. These results suggest that inhibition of PKC-mediated ODC gene expression by glycosaminoglycans may represent an important mechanism in the regulation of HEC proliferation.",valid,

It is argued that a theory developed only at the computational level is much like a single-bladed knife that is only useful in highly idealized situations. To be useful as a general tool that cuts through the complex fabric of cognition, we need at least two-bladed scissors that combine both computational and psychological constraints to characterize human behavior. To temper its sometimes expansive claims, it is time to show what a Bayesian model cannot explain. Insight as to how human reality may differ from the Bayesian predictions may shed more light on human cognition than the simpler focus on what the Bayesian approach can explain. There remains much to be done in terms of integrating Bayesian approaches and other approaches in modeling human cognition.",valid,

Despite that neuronal mitophagy and subsequent clearance of damaged neurons exert protective effect, the pathogenesis of HIE and effective treatment strategies for intervention of HIE remain poorly understood. Here, we report that ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (Usp14, a deubiquitinating enzyme) is closely associated with HIE progression by its negative regulation in neuronal mitophagy in mouse. The expression of Usp14 is elevated in both an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) mouse neuronal cell line culture model in vitro and a HIE mouse model in vivo. Mechanistically, OGD treatment activates Hippo signaling that enhances Yap1 phosphorylation levels at Ser-127 but inhibits Yap1 protein level, which potentiates Usp14 transcription and leads to the downregulated ubiquitination at Lys-63 of Beclin-1, a key molecule in autophagy, resulting in the suppressed neuronal mitophagy, subsequent failure in the clearance of damaged neurons, and finally possible dysregulation in brain functions. Thus, our results provide with Usp14 as a novel target and treatment strategy for intervention of HIE, which may help diagnose and treat HIE in clinic.",valid,

We then review the current state of primarily ultimate explanations of this diversity in social behaviour. We approach the question of how and why the balance between behavioural flexibility and continuity is achieved by discussing the genetic, developmental, ecological and social constraints on hypothetically unlimited behavioural flexibility. We introduce the other contributions to this Theme Issue against this background and conclude that constraints are often crucial to the evolution and expression of behavioural flexibility.

In order to dissect the role of P53 in the hematopoietic system, we generated and analyzed two different mouse models deficient for P53. A pan-hematopoietic P53 deletion mouse was created using Vav1-Cre based deletion; and a B-cell-specific deletion mouse was created using a CD19-Cre based deletion. The Vav1-P53CKO mice predominantly developed T-cell malignancies in younger mice, and myeloid malignancies in older mice. In T-cell malignancies, there was accelerated thymic cell maturation with overexpression of Notch1 and its downstream effectors. CD19-P53CKO mice developed marginal zone expansion in the spleen, followed by marginal zone lymphoma, some of which progressed to diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Interestingly, marginal zone and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas had a unique gene expression signature characterized by activation of the PI3K pathway, compared with wild type marginal zone or follicular cells of the spleen.

Because chronic myelogenic leukemia (CML) cells are derived from a lineage closely related to MM, we immunized mice by contrasting a pool of MM cells with CML cells.

By immunohistochemistry, mAb VAC69 showed no binding to antigens expressed on normal human ovary, breast, prostate, lung or colon tissue, nor did it bind to human breast or prostate cancer. Conversely, mAb VAC69 bound strongly to human MM, although showing only slight binding to histiocytes or inflamed cells in human lymph nodes and human tumors of the colon, lung, and ovary. Monoclonal antibody VAC69 also triggered cancer-specific cytotoxicity in vitro (in the presence of complement) as well as in vivo using a sever combined immunodeficiency model transplanted with human MM.

It was subsequently identified in other gypsy communities. The disorder, which is of autosomal recessive inheritance, was mapped to chromosome 8q24. It begins consistently in the first decade of life with gait disorder followed by upper limb weakness in the second decade and, in most subjects, by deafness which is most often first noticed in the third decade. Sensory loss affecting all modalities is present, both this and the motor involvement predominating distally in the limbs. Skeletal deformity, particularly foot deformity, is frequent. Severely reduced motor nerve conduction velocity indicates a demyelinating basis, which was confirmed by nerve biopsy. The three younger patients biopsied showed a hypertrophic 'onion bulb' neuropathy. The hypertrophic changes were not evident in the oldest individual biopsied and it is likely that they had regressed secondarily to axon loss. In the eight cases in which brainstem auditory evoked potentials could be recorded, the results suggested demyelination in the eighth cranial nerve and also abnormal conduction in the central auditory pathways in the brainstem.

In male mice, concurrent subcutaneous A61603 infusion at 10 ng/kg/d for 7 days after a single intraperitoneal dose of doxorubicin (25 mg/kg) increased survival, improved cardiac function, heart rate, and cardiac output by echocardiography, and reduced cardiac cell necrosis and apoptosis and myocardial fibrosis. All protective effects were lost in alpha-1A-knockout mice. In female mice, doxorubicin at doses higher than in males (35-40 mg/kg) caused less cardiac toxicity than in males.

We now find the same compounds inhibit AChE from cockroaches (Blattella germanica and Periplaneta americana), the flour beetle (Tribolium confusum), the multi-colored Asian ladybird beetle (Harmonia axyridis), the bed bug (Cimex lectularius), and a wasp (Vespula maculifrons), with IC(50) values of approximately 1-11muM. Our results support further study of Cys-targeting inhibitors as conceptually novel insecticides that may be free of resistance in a range of insect pests and disease vectors and, compared with current compounds, should demonstrate much lower toxicity to mammals, birds, and fish.",valid,

These characteristics enable these tissues to endure significant mechanical stresses and swiftly recover after deformation, contributing to their exceptional durability and functionality. In contrast, while hydrogels are highly biocompatible and hold promise as synthetic biomaterials, their inherent network structure often limits their ability to simultaneously possess a diverse range of superior mechanical properties. As a result, the applications of hydrogels are significantly constrained. This article delves into the design mechanisms and mechanical properties of various tough hydrogels and investigates their applications in tissue engineering, flexible electronics, and other fields. The objective is to provide insights into the fabrication and application of hydrogels with combined high strength, stretchability, toughness, and fast recovery as well as their future development directions and challenges.",valid,10932079

Civil unrest is a prime example, involving the spontaneous appearance of large crowds of otherwise unrelated people on the street on a certain day. While indicators of brewing protests might be gleaned from individual online communications or account content (e.g. Twitter, Facebook) societal concerns regarding privacy can make such probing a politically delicate issue. Here we show that instead, a simple low-level indicator of civil unrest can be obtained from online data at the aggregate level through Google Trends or similar tools. Our study covers countries across Latin America during 2011-2014 in which diverse civil unrest events took place. In each case, we find that the combination of the volume and momentum of searches from Google Trends surrounding pairs of simple keywords, tailored for the specific cultural setting, provide good indicators of periods of civil unrest.

In neuroscience applications, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been used to improve electronic device performance by exploiting their physical properties. Besides, when manufactured to interface neuronal networks formation in vitro, CNT carpets have shown their unique ability to potentiate synaptic networks formation and function. Due to the low optical transparency of CNTs films, further developments of these materials in neural prosthesis fabrication or in implementing interfacing devices to be paired with in vivo imaging or in vitro optogenetic approaches are currently limited. In the present work, we exploit a new method to fabricate CNTs by growing them on a fused silica surface, which results in a transparent CNT-based substrate (tCNTs). We show that tCNTs favor dissociated primary neurons network formation and function, an effect comparable to the one observed for their dark counterparts. We further adopt tCNTs to support the growth of intact or lesioned entorhinal-hippocampal complex organotypic cultures (EHCs). Through immunocytochemistry and electrophysiological field potential recordings, we show here that tCNTs platforms are suitable substrates for the growth of EHCs and we unmask their ability to significantly increase the signal synchronization and fiber sprouting between the cortex and the hippocampus with respect to Controls. tCNTs transparency and ability to enhance recovery of lesioned brain cultures, make them optimal candidates to implement implantable devices in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.",valid,

In similar circumstances, a simple allopatric speciation model that identifies the origins of genetic isolation within temporal geographic separation is considered as the default model. However, secondary contact between differentiated lineages can result in similar distributional patterns to those arising from a process of parapatric speciation (where gene flow between lineages remains uninterrupted during differentiation). Our aim was to use the characteristic distributional patterns in Telopea to test whether it reflected the evolutionary models of allopatric or parapatric speciation. Using a combination of genetic evidence and environmental niche modelling, we focused on three main questions: do currently described geographic borders coincide with genetic and environmental boundaries; are there hybrid zones in areas of secondary contact between closely related species; did species distributions contract during the last glacial maximum resulting in distributional gaps even where overlap and hybridisation currently occur?",valid,3495659
3707149,"THP-adriamycin (THP) is a new derivative of adriamycin (ADM) which is reported to have a lower cardiotoxicity than ADM. In this report, the effects of THP on cell growth, cell cycle traverse and colony-forming ability of RPMI-8402 cells were investigated in comparison with ADM. The growth-inhibitory effect of THP was equal or superior to that of ADM in this system. Analysis of the DNA histogram obtained by flow cytometry showed that THP exerted its growth-inhibitory effect by blocking cells at the G2 phase. At higher concentrations, THP inhibited the traverse of cells through the S phase and further through the whole cell cycle completely. These effects were quite similar to those of ADM, which suggested a similar mechanism of action for the two drugs from the aspect of the cell cycle. A follow-up study of cells accumulated at the G2 phase and a study on colony-forming ability revealed that the G2 phase accumulation was an irreversible and fatal effect of THP, so that G2-phase accumulation could be considered as a cytocidal effect of THP, indicating the clinical usefulness of this system for evaluation of the drug effect. From these results and the low cardiotoxicity, it was suggested that THP could be a good candidate for use as an antitumor agent in clinics.",valid,

Vpx is essential or critical for viral replication in natural target cells such as macrophages and T lymphocytes. We have previously shown that a poly-proline motif (PPM) located at the C-terminal region of Vpx is required for its efficient expression in two strains of HIV-2 and SIVmac, and that the Vpx expression levels of the two clones are significantly different. Notably, the PPM sequence is conserved and confined to Vpx and Vpr proteins derived from certain lineages of HIV-2/SIVs. In this study, Vpx/Vpr proteins from diverse primate lentiviral lineages were experimentally and phylogenetically analyzed to obtain the general expression picture in cells. While both the level and PPM-dependency of Vpx/Vpr expression in transfected cells varied among viral strains, each viral group, based on Vpx/Vpr amino acid sequences, was found to exhibit a characteristic expression profile. Moreover, phylogenetic tree analyses on Gag and Vpx/Vpr proteins gave essentially the same results. Taken together, our study described here suggests that each primate lentiviral lineage may have developed a unique expression pattern of Vpx/Vpr proteins for adaptation to its hostile cellular and species environments in the process of viral evolution.",valid,4971069

The present study assessed neurophysiological changes in spontaneous EEG activity, visual-evoked cortical potentials (VEPs), and brainstem auditory-evoked potentials (BAEPs) during IFN-gamma or IFN-alpha therapy in 9 patients. In addition, blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature were monitored. In all sessions under IFN, the latency of the P100 component of the VEP was shortened as compared to baseline conditions. IFN also reduced latencies of BAEP components, and diminished amplitudes of the spontaneous EEG activity within the alpha and beta frequency band. These latter effects were somewhat less consistent than those on VEPs. The major neurophysiological changes appeared to be similar for IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha. The results are in accord with an excitatory effect of IFN on central nervous activity.

Twenty-seven patients with ICPs or ICDs had continuous electrocardiogram monitoring and device interrogation to detect interferences during the use of two types of EALs and one EPT. No interferences were detected by any ICP or ICD. In six patients, with intermittent pacing, a significant increase in pacing was observed during EAL/EPT stimulation (p < 0.05). Examination of RR intervals (a measure of intrinsic heart rate) demonstrated significantly longer RR intervals (slower intrinsic heart rate) during EAL/EPT stimulation (p < 0.05). Evaluation of the electrocardiograms for each patient failed to show any abnormalities in pacing during testing. These findings led us to conclude that the increased pacing frequency observed was related to a slower intrinsic heart rate and not electrical interference with the cardiac devices. In conclusion, the two EALs and one EPT used in this study did not interfere with the functioning of any of the cardiac devices tested.",valid,

The TGF-β1 polymorphism was evaluated in 336 patients with ACS and 396 healthy control subjects by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The genotype distributions of the control and ACS groups were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (X(2) = 3.54 and X(2) = 1.72, respectively, P > 0.05).

8817245,"To analyze the relative contribution of endocrine and physical factors to bone mineral density (BMD) in late menopause, we studied biochemical markers of bone turnover as well as sex and calciotropic hormones in 53 women (mean age 61 +/- 5.3 years), 5 to 23 years after natural menopause. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine and proximal femur by dual energy radiography. Stepwise regression analysis showed that age and PTH levels were the two major factors that significantly accounted for spinal BMD, with a final r2 = 0.27. Plasma androstenedione was the only other variable that contributed, albeit not significantly, to spine BMD increasing the r2 by 2%. Conversely, body mass was the main contributor to femoral BMD at all sites. While serum calcium and urinary hydroxyproline were significant determinants of neck BMD, urinary hydroxyproline and age provided significant source of variation for trochanteric BMD, and circulating FSH for BMD in the Ward's area. The final models gave r2 values of 0.35, 0.31, and 0.23, for neck, trochanter and Ward's areas, respectively. Thus, determinants of bone density differentially affect the vertebral and proximal femoral sites. While increasing age and PTH, probably reflecting a subclinical vitamin D deficiency, explain a decreased vertebral bone density, body mass appears to affect mostly the proximal femur. Circulating androgens play a secondary role. A persistently increased bone turnover state is conducive to lower bone density in late postmenopausal women.",valid,

The method is tested on EEG recordings obtained from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients, and matched healthy volunteers, for eyes-open and eyes-closed resting-state conditions, and the resulting functional networks are analysed through standard topological metrics. Both groups of patients are characterised by a reduction in the identifiability of the corresponding EEG signals, and by differences in the patterns that support such identifiability. Resulting functional networks are similar, but not identical to those reconstructed by using a correlation metric.

At the time of the PK study, mean CLZ dose was 200 mg (3.4 mg/kg). Serum was collected during week 6 on CLZ before and 0.5-8 h after a morning dose. Serum concentrations were assayed by liquid chromatography/UV-detection. Mean concentration, area-under-the-curve (AUC), and clearance were calculated. CLZ clearance averaged 1.7 L/kg-h. NOR concentrations (410) exceeded CLZ (289) and NOX (63 ng/ml) and AUC(0-8h) of NOR (3,356) > CLZ (2,359) > NOX (559 ng/ml-h) [53, 38, and 9% of total analytes, respectively]. In adults, NOR serum concentrations on average are 10-25% < CLZ, differing significantly from our sample. Dose normalized concentrations of CLZ (mg/kg-d) did not vary with age and were similar to reported adult values. Clinical improvement seen in 5/6 patients correlated with serum CLZ concentrations.

Mice deficient in stable tubule only polypeptide (STOP) show cognitive, behavioral, and neurobiological deficits that resemble those seen in patients with schizophrenia, but little is known about their sleep phenotype. We characterized baseline sleep/wake patterns and recovery sleep following sleep deprivation in STOP null mice. Polysomnography was conducted in adult male STOP null and wild-type (WT) mice under a 12:12 hours light:dark cycle before, during, and after 6 hours of sleep deprivation during the light phase. At baseline, STOP null mice spent more time awake and less time in non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) over a 24-hour period, with more frequent transitions between wake and NREMS, compared to WT mice, especially during the dark phase. The distributions of wake, NREMS and REMS across the light and the dark phases differed by genotype, and so did features of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Following sleep deprivation, both genotypes showed homeostatic increases in sleep duration, with no significant genotype differences in the initial compensatory increase in sleep intensity (EEG delta power). These results indicate that STOP null mice sleep less overall, and their sleep and wake periods are more fragmented than those of WT mice.

The experiment was divided into a control group, an AR group, an IL-9 shRNA+AR group, and a vector+AR group. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to detect pathological changes. The cytokine expression was detected by ELISA method. Cellular typing was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS Cells in the control group were regularly arranged, with clear layers and no congestion, edema, or necrosis observable. By contrast, in the AR model group and the vector treatment group, nasal mucosa showed clear hyperemia and edema in upper tissues and infiltration of inflammatory cells, which were ameliorated by IL-9 silencing. Compared with the control group, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was significantly down-regulated, while IL-4, IL-17, and IL-9 were significantly elevated in the AR model group. TH1 cells in nasal mucosa, lymph, nasal lavage, spleen, and peripheral blood were significantly reduced, while TH2, TH9, TH17, and Treg cells were significantly elevated in the AR group compared with the control group. Importantly, all these changes in AR model were ameliorated by IL-9 silencing.

The high sample capacity afforded by chromatographic methods generates enough sample to achieve comprehensive serum peptidome identification (357 proteins) through tandem mass spectrometric analysis of both intact and digested peptides. Sample losses during transfer between modules are minimized through precise fluidic control; no clogging occurred over several months of serum processing in our low back pressure system. Computer controlled operation of both modules and thorough optimization yield excellent run-to-run reproducibility and protein/peptide overlap in analytical repeats.

Brain networks were reconstructed from diffusion-weighted MRI scans in 72 individuals (75 ± 8 years) with cognitive impairment and SVD on MRI. The centrality of white matter connections in the network was defined using graph theory. The association between the fractional anisotropy (FA) of central versus non-central connections, executive functioning, and markers of SVD was evaluated with linear regression and mediation analysis. Lower FA in central network connections was more strongly associated with impairment in executive functioning than FA in non-central network connections (r = 0.41 vs. r = 0.27; P < 0.05). Results were consistent across varying thresholds to define the central subnetwork (>50%-10% connections). Higher SVD burden was associated with lower FA in central as well as non-central network connections. However, only central network FA mediated the relationship between white matter hyperintensity volume and executive functioning [change in regression coefficient after mediation (95% CI): -0.15 (-0.35 to -0.02)]. The mediation effect was not observed for FA alterations in non-central network connections [-0.03 (-0.19 to 0.04)]. These findings suggest that the centrality of network connections, and thus their contribution to global network efficiency, appears to be relevant for understanding the relationship between SVD and cognitive impairment.

19125961,"Objectives To assess the prevalence, clinical and immunological characteristics, risk factors and survival of patients with AIDS-related cryptococcosis in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Methods All newly diagnosed cryptococcosis cases identified retrospectively from among a series of AIDS patients hospitalized consecutively at a single institution in Italy in 1985-1996 (pre-HAART period, n=165) and 1997-2006 (post-HAART period, n=40) were analysed comparatively. Results The prevalence of cryptococcosis decreased from 4.7% (165/3543) to 2.2% (40/1805) between the pre- and post-HAART periods (P=0.0001). There were no differences in the clinical features or immunological status of the patients between the two cohorts. The variables associated with the occurrence of cryptococcosis in the post-HAART era were older age (P<0.001), no previous diagnosis of HIV infection (P<0.001) and infection in homosexual males (P=0.004). During the post-HAART period, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome associated with cryptococcosis was observed in five patients (19.3%) a median of 15 weeks after the start of HAART. Thirty-day survival (P=0.045) and overall survival (P=0.0001) were significantly better among patients diagnosed with cryptococcosis in the post-HAART compared to those diagnosed in the pre-HAART era. Conclusions The AIDS-associated cryptococcosis observed in Western countries in the HAART era has similar clinical and immunological characteristics to that observed in the pre-HAART era, but a significantly better outcome.",valid,

32152598,"Crosstalk between neighboring cells underlies many biological processes, including cell signaling, proliferation and differentiation. Current single-cell genomic technologies profile each cell separately after tissue dissociation, losing information on cell-cell interactions. In the present study, we present an approach for sequencing physically interacting cells (PIC-seq), which combines cell sorting of physically interacting cells (PICs) with single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using computational modeling, PIC-seq systematically maps in situ cellular interactions and characterizes their molecular crosstalk. We apply PIC-seq to interrogate diverse interactions including immune-epithelial PICs in neonatal murine lungs. Focusing on interactions between T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro and in vivo, we map T cell-DC interaction preferences, and discover regulatory T cells as a major T cell subtype interacting with DCs in mouse draining lymph nodes. Analysis of T cell-DC pairs reveals an interaction-specific program between pathogen-presenting migratory DCs and T cells. PIC-seq provides a direct and broadly applicable technology to characterize intercellular interaction-specific pathways at high resolution.",valid,

Simultaneous trajectories of brain and behavior, however, are understudied, especially in these environmental contexts. In this four-wave study spanning 9-18 years of age (N=224 at baseline, N=138 at final assessment) we used longitudinal k-means clustering to identify clusters of participants with distinct trajectories of uncinate fasciculus (UF) fractional anisotropy (FA) and anxiety symptoms; we examined behavioral outcomes and identified environmental factors that predicted cluster membership. We identified three clusters of participants: 1) high UF FA and low symptoms (""low-risk""); 2) low UF FA and high symptoms (""high-risk""); and 3) low UF FA and low symptoms (""resilient""). Adolescents in disadvantaged neighborhoods were more likely to be in the resilient than high-risk cluster if they also experienced maternal warmth. Thus, neighborhood disadvantage may confer neural risk for psychopathology that can be buffered by maternal warmth, highlighting the importance of considering multiple environmental influences in understanding emotional and neural development in youth.",valid,11056613

We find that the surface can form a self-contacting crease at the leading front, which results from a buildup of compressive stress. Experimentally, creases are observed on substrates that exhibit either high or low adhesion when measured in the normal direction, motivating the use of simulations to consider the role of adhesion energy and interfacial strength. Our simulations illustrate that the interfacial strength plays a dominating role in the nucleation of a crease. After the crease forms, it progresses through the contact zone in a Schallamach wave-like fashion. Interestingly, our results suggest that this Schallamach wave-like motion is facilitated by free slip at the adhesive, self-contacting interface within the crease.",valid,10126204

However, the use of pharmacological prophylaxis could carry out undesirable side-effects on mother and fetus. Thus, the prediction of hypotension becomes an important challenge. Hypotension events are hypothesized to be related to a malfunctioning of autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation of blood pressure. In this work, ANS responses to positional changes of 51 pregnant women programmed for a cesarean labor were explored for hypotension prediction. Lateral and supine decubitus, and sitting position were considered while electrocardiographic and pulse photoplethysmographic signals were recorded. Features based on heart rate variability, pulse rate variability (PRV) and pulse transit time (PTT) analysis were used in a logistic regression classifier. The results showed that PRV irregularity changes, assessed by approximate entropy, from supine to lateral decubitus, and standard deviation of PTT in supine decubitus were found as the combination of features that achieved the best classification results sensitivity of 76%, specificity of 70% and accuracy of 72%, being normotensive the positive class.

All of the Bacteroides fragilis group and 51% of the non-Bacteroides fragilis group were beta-lactamase positive. Amongst the non-Bacteroides fragilis group, beta-lactamase positivity rates were higher for US strains (58%) than for European strains (39%). All strains were susceptible to imipenem and metronidazole. MIC90s of amoxicillin and ticarcillin for all beta-lactamase negative strains were 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The addition of clavulanate reduced the MIC90s of amoxicillin (> or = 256 micrograms/ml) and ticarcillin (> or = 64 micrograms/ml) to 16 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the Bacteroides fragilis group, and to 4 micrograms/ml for both agents for the non-Bacteroides fragilis beta-lactamase producing group. Twenty-nine cefoxitin-resistant strains were found, mainly in the Bacteroides fragilis group, while 95 beta-lactamase producing strains (predominantly Bacteroides fragilis group and fusobacteria) did not show synergy between beta-lactams and clavulanate. Of the newe agents tested, meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active (100% of strains susceptible), followed by amoxicillin-BRL 42715 (99% of strains susceptible); 94 to 98% of the strains were susceptible to cefoperazone-sulbactam, tosufloxacin, temafloxacin and clindamycin.

38001396,"Amphibian species have the largest genome size enriched with repetitive sequences and relatively similar karyotypes. Moreover, many amphibian species frequently hybridize causing nuclear and mitochondrial genome introgressions. In addition, hybridization in some amphibian species may lead to clonality and polyploidization. All such events were found in water frogs from the genus Pelophylax. Among the species within the genus Pelophylax, P. esculentus complex is the most widely distributed and well-studied. This complex includes two parental species, P. ridibundus and P. lessonae, and their hybrids, P. esculentus, reproducing hemiclonally. Parental species and their hybrids have similar but slightly polymorphic karyotypes, so their precise identification is still required. Here, we have developed a complete set of 13 chromosome painting probes for two parental species allowing the precise identification of all chromosomes. Applying chromosomal painting, we identified homologous chromosomes in both parental species and orthologous chromosomes in their diploid hemiclonal hybrids. Comparative painting did not reveal interchromosomal exchanges between the studied water frog species and their hybrids. Using cross-specific chromosome painting, we detected unequal distribution of the signals along chromosomes suggesting the presence of species-specific tandem repeats. Application of chromosomal paints to the karyotypes of hybrids revealed differences in the intensity of staining for P. ridibundus and P. lessonae chromosomes. Thus, both parental genomes have a divergence in unique sequences. Obtained chromosome probes may serve as a powerful tool to unravel chromosomal evolution in phylogenetically related species, identify individual chromosomes in different cell types, and investigate the elimination of chromosomes in hybrid water frogs.",valid,

35208392,"The vision chip is widely used to acquire and process images. It connects the image sensor directly with the vision processing unit (VPU) to execute the vision tasks. Modern vision tasks mainly consist of image signal processing (ISP) algorithms and deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the traditional VPUs are unsuitable for the DNNs, and the DNN processing units (DNPUs) cannot process the ISP algorithms. Meanwhile, only the CNNs and the CNN-RNN frameworks are used in the vision tasks, and few DNPUs are specifically designed for this. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous architecture for the VPU with a hybrid accelerator for the DNNs. It can process the ISP, CNNs, and hybrid DNN subtasks on one unit. Furthermore, we present a sharing scheme to multiplex the hardware resources for different subtasks. We also adopt a pipelined workflow for the vision tasks to fully use the different processing modules and achieve a high processing speed. We implement the proposed VPU on the field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and several vision tasks are tested on it.

In the present study, a focus was placed on human parotid gland expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Parotid salivary tissue was obtained from patients undergoing the gland dissection. Quantitative real-time PCR aimmunohistochemical staining were used for expression studies. The highest mRNA expression was documented for NFE2L2 coding for Nrf2. Lower expression was seen in the case of AHR gene coding for AhR. PXR was constitutively present at very low level and CAR expression was below the limit of quantification. Immunohistochemical evaluation of the parotid gland specimens revealed cytoplasmic Nrf2 expression in striated duct cells as well as within myoepithelial cells. Acinar cells were mostly negative for Nrf2. Expression of AhR was found within the cytoplasm in striated duct cells. Acinar and myoepithelial cells were negative for AhR.

One glycoprotein of Mr approximately 1.3 X 10(5) and pI approximately 4.8 (gp130) is present in intact retinas and, in the presence of Ca2+, is both resistant to tryptic cleavage and poorly iodinated. When cultured in vitro, iodinated retinas release into the medium a number of iodinated polypeptides; one of the major iodinated components is a polypeptide of Mr approximately 9 X 10(4) and pI approximately 4.8 (gp90). This component is also resistant to tryptic cleavage in the presence of Ca2+. Two-dimensional peptide maps of gp130 and gp90 derived respectively from iodinated retinas and their conditioned media are very similar. Maps of samples reiodinated following denaturation show the same similarities as well as additional labeled peptides. Furthermore, the two-dimensional peptide maps of the two molecules prepared from retinas cultured in the presence of [3H]glucosamine are identical. We conclude that gp90 is a turnover fragment of gp130 and comprises that portion of gp130 exposed at the cell surface.

These inconsistencies possibly stem from methodological artifacts: distractor inhibition is typically assessed with the negative priming paradigm, which confounds inhibition and episodic retrieval. In the present study, we investigated age differences in a sequential distractor repetition paradigm (Giesen, Frings, & Rothermund, 2012) that provides independent estimates of distractor inhibition and episodic retrieval processes. Older (60+ yrs) and younger (below 30 years) adults identified target letters that were flanked by distractors (JKJ). Inhibitory processes were preserved in older adults, who showed reliable distractor repetition benefits resulting from persistent distractor inhibition; however, a significant loss of inhibition was apparent for the older subgroup of participants (65+ yrs) compared with a subgroup of young-old participants (60 to 64 years). No age differences were found for episodic retrieval processes of stimulus-response bindings that were indexed by an interaction of distractor repetition and response relation. Findings highlight the importance of dissociating between distractor inhibition and retrieval processes that are differently implicated in age-related cognitive change.",valid,

Liposome fusion was demonstrated by (a) negative-stain electron microscopy, (b) gel filtration, and (c) resonance energy transfer of the fluorescent phospholipids. Liposome fusion required the presence of polyhistidine, whereas histidine at equivalent concentrations had no effect. Little or no liposome fusion was detectable at pH 7.4, but it was greatly enhanced when the pH of the medium was reduced below 6.5. Although acidic phospholipid is necessary for fusion, liposomes made of acidic lipids alone showed only low levels of fusion activity. Liposomes composed of mixtures (1:1) of a negatively charged phospholipid and a neutral phospholipid such as phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), but not sphingomyelin, showed high levels (about 80%) of fusion competency. For liposomes made of PE/phosphatidylserine (PS) (1:1), fusion at pH 5.2 and 2.5 micrograms/mL polyhistidine resulted in an increase in the average liposome diameter from 296 to 2400 A, indicating multiple rounds of fusion had occurred. Liposome fusion was not very leaky as revealed by the lack of release of encapsulated calcein. For PE/PS (1:1) liposomes, about 10% of dye leakage was observed for up to about 30% liposome fusion and about 45% leakage at 80% liposome fusion. Since polyhistidine becomes a strong polycation at acidic pH, liposome fusion may be a direct result of the bilayer phase separation induced by the binding of polyhistidine with the negatively charged phospholipids. Therefore, this phenomenon is similar to the liposome fusion induced by other polycations such as polylysine at neutral pH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",valid,

29683229,"The initiation of spontaneous breast cancer (SBC) in Tientsin Albino 2 (TA2) mice is related to mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) infection, and MMTV amplification is hormonally regulated. To explore the insertion site of MMTVLTR in TA2 mouse genome, reverse PCR and nested PCR were used to amplify the unknown sequence on both sides of the MMTV-LTRSAG gene in SBC and normal breast tissue of TA2 mice. Furthermore, the clinicopathological significance of the insertion site was evaluated in 43 samples of normal breast tissue, 46 samples of breast cystic hyperplasia, 54 samples of ductal carcinoma in situ, 142 samples of primary breast cancer and 47 samples of lymph node metastatic breast cancer by RNA in situ hybridization. We confirmed that the insertion site of the MMTV-LTRSAG gene was located between Igκv2-112 and Igκv14-111 in chromosome 6 of TA2 mouse. IGκC was localized in the stromal cells of TA2 mouse with SBC and in human breast cancer tissues. Tumor cells were negative for IGκC in RNA in situ hybridization. The positive staining index of IGκC in stromal cells was the highest in lymph node metastatic breast cancer, followed by primary breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, and breast cystic hyperplasia. Furthermore, the positive staining index of IGκC was related to the expression of ER, PR, HER2 and Ki-67. Our findings showed that stromal IGκC expression was associated with the initiation of SBC in TA2 mice. IGκC may be a high-risk factor for the initiation and progression of human breast cancer.",valid,5989835

Specific aspects, like the low mechanical quality of bone tissue, the contemporary damage of several joints and the higher risk of complications, have to be taken into account in rheumatoid arthritis. The experience with 24 prostheses in 21 rheumatoid patients is reported and confirms the efficacy of this operation. Among the technical details discussed, stress is placed on the conservation of the posterior cruciate ligament, the use of cement, the procedure of patelloplasty instead of prosthetic replacement. Careful preoperative planning is required and resections, especially in the tibia, should be economical.

Analysis of the sensitivity and resolution parameters derived from the electrochemical response of such films indicates that PEDOT is the most appropriate for the unambiguous detection of the three species. Indeed, the performance of PEDOT is practically independent of the presence of both gold nanoparticles at the surface of the film and interphases inside the film, even though these two factors are known to improve the electroactivity of conducting polymers. Quantum mechanical calculations on model complexes have been used to examine the intermolecular interaction involved in complexes formed by PEDOT chains and oxidized dopamine, ascorbic acid and uric acid. Results show that such complexes are mainly stabilized by C-HO interactions rather than by conventional hydrogen bonds. In order to improve the sensitivity of PEDOT through the formation of specific hydrogen bonds, a derivative bearing a hydroxymethyl group attached to the dioxane ring of each repeat unit has been designed. Poly(hydroxymethyl-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PHMeDOT) has been prepared and characterized by FTIR, UV-vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy.

The origins of salivary IGF-I concentrations were studied. Intracardial administration of Sprague-Dawley rats with 125I-labelled IGF-I and subsequent analysis of plasma and saliva samples by exclusion gel chromatography and SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography, demonstrated the apparent inability of IGF-I to cross from the plasma pool through to saliva. 125I-Labelled IGF-I was not chromatographed immediately before injection, resulting in administration of free iodide along with the iodinated peptide. This free iodide was demonstrable in saliva, indicating that movement of substances from plasma to saliva was measurable using the levels of 125I activity administered. Free iodide in saliva was not contributed to by 125I-labelled IGF-I degradation since 125I-labelled IGF-I was shown to be stable in saliva over 24 h. These data indicated that IGF-I in saliva is produced locally.

Considering the articulating joint as an organ it would be beneficial to include more complex stimulation. Within this study we applied clinically relevant kinematic load to biphasic constructs. In each case, the upper layer consisted of fibrin embedded hMSCs retained within an elastomeric polyurethane (PU) scaffold. These were randomly assigned to five base scaffolds, a cell-free fibrin PU base, viable bone, decellularized bone, 3D printed calcium phosphate or clinically used cement. This allowed the study of cross talk between viable bone and chondrogenically differentiating MSCs, while controlling for the change in stiffness of the base material. Data obtained showed that the bulk stiffness of the construct was not the defining factor in the response obtained, with viable and decellularized bone producing similar results to the softer PU base. However, the stiff synthetic materials led to reduced chondrogenesis and increased calcification in the upper MSC seeded layer. This demonstrates that the underlying base material must be considered when driving chondrogenesis of human cells using a clinically relevant loading protocol.

21372322,"Deinococcus radiodurans is a robust bacterium best known for its capacity to repair massive DNA damage efficiently and accurately. It is extremely resistant to many DNA-damaging agents, including ionizing radiation and UV radiation (100 to 295 nm), desiccation, and mitomycin C, which induce oxidative damage not only to DNA but also to all cellular macromolecules via the production of reactive oxygen species. The extreme resilience of D. radiodurans to oxidative stress is imparted synergistically by an efficient protection of proteins against oxidative stress and an efficient DNA repair mechanism, enhanced by functional redundancies in both systems. D. radiodurans assets for the prevention of and recovery from oxidative stress are extensively reviewed here. Radiation- and desiccation-resistant bacteria such as D. radiodurans have substantially lower protein oxidation levels than do sensitive bacteria but have similar yields of DNA double-strand breaks. These findings challenge the concept of DNA as the primary target of radiation toxicity while advancing protein damage, and the protection of proteins against oxidative damage, as a new paradigm of radiation toxicity and survival. The protection of DNA repair and other proteins against oxidative damage is imparted by enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defense systems dominated by divalent manganese complexes. Given that oxidative stress caused by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species is associated with aging and cancer, a comprehensive outlook on D. radiodurans strategies of combating oxidative stress may open new avenues for antiaging and anticancer treatments.

Adenosine and the stable adenosine analogues 5'-(N-ethyl)carboxamido adenosine (NECA) and (-)-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA) produced a concentration-dependent direct negative inotropic effect. Responses to NECA and R-PIA were insensitive to atropine and were shifted to the right by the adenosine receptor antagonist 3-isobutyl-1-methyl xanthine (IBMX). NECA and R-PIA were found to reverse positive inotropic responses of left atria to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol, but were less effective at reversing positive inotropic responses to the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, and were almost ineffective at reversing positive inotropic responses to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation. Neither NECA nor R-PIA had a significant effect on basal cAMP levels or on cAMP levels elevated by isoproterenol in rabbit left atria. Similarly, R-PIA had no significant effect on basal cAMP levels or isoproterenol-induced increases in cAMP in the presence of adenosine deaminase to remove the influence of endogenous adenosine. Pretreatment of rabbits with 1.75 micrograms/kg pertussis toxin attenuated both the direct negative inotropic response of left atria to NECA and responses to NECA in the presence of isoproterenol and forskolin to a similar extent. Pretreatment of left atrial preparations with the potassium channel antagonist 4-aminopyridine resulted in a dose dependent attenuation of responses to NECA alone and in the presence of isoproterenol and forskolin.

Construction of the above-mentioned molecular structural motif is challenging because two different arylacetylide ligands are incorporated in the complex; normally two homoleptic acetylide ligands were used for this kind of N(∧)N Pt(II) complexes. A reference complex with trans bis(tributylphosphine) Pt(II) bisacetylide protocol (Pt-4) was prepared for comparison of the photophysical properties. The two different Bodipy ligands in Pt-1 and Pt-4 constitute singlet/triplet energy donor/acceptor, as a result the harvested photoexcitation energy can be funneled to the triplet state confined on one of the two Bodipy ligands. The photophysical properties of the complexes were studied with steady state UV-vis absorption and luminescence spectroscopies, femto- and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry, as well as DFT/TDDFT calculations.

7886938,"Contrary to a previous report, electron microscopic studies on the Fny strain of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-infected tobacco tissues revealed that plasmodesmata were not structurally modified during CMV infection, nor were virions ever observed in plasmodesmata connecting infected cells. To further explore the basis of CMV infection, experiments were performed on the CMV 3a ORF. The 3a protein of CMV was expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli. The purified protein was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and subsequently microinjected into mesophyll cells of mature leaves of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Turkish Samsun NN. Within a brief period (as little as 1 sec), the microinjected FITC-labeled CMV 3a protein moved into neighboring cells. Co-injection of unlabeled CMV 3a protein with 9.4-kDa fluorescein-conjugated dextran (F-dextran) resulted in extensive cell-to-cell movement (diffusion) of the F-dextran, indicating that the 3a protein can interact with and dilate plasmodesmata. Furthermore, co-injection of unlabeled 3a protein with fluorescently labeled infectious CMV RNA molecules resulted in rapid and extensive cell-to-cell transport. In contrast, a mutant form of the 3a protein was unable to traffic from cell to cell, to increase the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata, or to potentiate cell-to-cell trafficking of CMV RNA molecules. Microinjection studies performed on transgenic tobacco plants expressing the CMV 3a protein indicated that fluorescently labeled CMV RNA moved out of the target cell into the surrounding mesophyll tissue. In addition, expression of the CMV 3a protein also potentiated the cell-to-cell movement of 9.4-kDa F-dextran. Collectively, these results provide direct experimental evidence that the CMV 3a protein functions as the movement protein of CMV. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that CMV moves from cell-to-cell in the form of a ribonucleoprotein complex.",valid,

Edeine A1, aurintricarboxylic acid and polydextran sulphate block the binding of the mRNA to the 40-S ribosomal subunit. Pactamycin induces the formation of stable smaller initiation complexes which are unable to go through the subsequent steps of initiation. Stimulation of the binding of the initiator Met-tRNAf to the 80-S ribosome in the presence of initiation factors is observed with sparsomycin and antibiotics of the sesquiterpene family (verrucarin A, trichodermin and trichothecin). However, these antibiotics block the reaction of the bound Met-tRNAf with puromycin. Narciclasine has no effect on the binding of the initiator to the ribosome but strongly blocks its reaction with puromycin.

21079844,"Surface segregation in (110) B2-NiAl film approximately 3 nm thick is investigated by using molecular dynamics simulation with a reliable embedded-atom potential. The simulation is performed for the stoichiometric composition at a temperature of 1500 K, just below the melting temperature of the film model. It is found that the (110) surface is structurally stable but develops adatoms, vacancies and antisites. The coverage of an adatom layer is estimated to be ∼0.07 ML (monatomic layers) and it contains on average ∼95% of Al atoms. The top (surface) and second (subsurface) layers of the (110) surface is the most enriched in Ni relative to the bulk composition. These layers contain on average ∼51% of Ni atoms. The Ni fraction in the third and forth layers of the film is estimated as ∼50.5%. The deeper layers have essentially the bulk composition. Vacancies in the film model are found only on the Ni sublattice. The vacancy concentration on the Ni sublattice in the top layer is ∼7.5%. The second layer almost does not contain vacancies. The next layers have essentially the constant bulk vacancy composition which can be estimated as ∼1.3-1.4%.",valid,

Although LT is associated with dyslipidemia, particularly atherogenic lipoprotein subparticles, the impact of these subparticles on CVD-related events is unknown. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the impact of small dense (sdLDL-C) low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) on CVD events. Prospectively enrolled patients (N = 130) had detailed lipid profile consisting of traditional lipid parameters and sdLDL-C and were followed for CVD events. The primary endpoint was a CVD composite consisting of myocardial infarction (MI), angina, need for coronary revascularization, and cardiac death. Mean age of the cohort was 58 ± 11 years, and the most common etiology of liver disease (LD) was hepatitis C virus (N = 48) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (N = 23). A total of 20 CVD events were noted after median follow-up of 45 months. The baseline traditional profile was similar in patients with and without CVD events. A serum LDL-C cutoff of 100 mg/dL was unable to identify individuals at risk of a CVD event (P = 0.86). In contrast, serum concentration of atherogenic sdLDL-C >25 mg/dL was predictive of CVD events with a hazard ratio of 6.376 (95% confidence interval, 2.65, 15.34; P < 0.001). This relationship was independent of diabetes, hypertension, sex, ethnicity, LD, obesity, and statin use. Conclusion: sdLDL-C independently predicted CVD events whereas LDL-C did not. Thus, sdLDL-C may provide a useful clinical tool in risk stratifying and managing patients after LT.",valid,7018439
15289563,"Melioidosis is a severe infectious disease of animals and humans caused by the Gram-negative intracellular pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei. An Inv/Mxi-Spa-like type III protein secretion apparatus, encoded by the B. pseudomallei bsa locus, facilitates bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, escape from endocytic vesicles and intracellular survival. This study investigated the role of the Bsa type III secretion system in the pathogenesis of melioidosis in murine models. B. pseudomallei bipD mutants, lacking a component of the translocation apparatus, were found to be significantly attenuated following intraperitoneal or intranasal challenge of BALB/c mice. Furthermore, a bipD mutant was attenuated in C57BL/6 IL-12 p40(-/-) mice, which are highly susceptible to B. pseudomallei infection. Mutation of bipD impaired bacterial replication in the liver and spleen of BALB/c mice in the early stages of infection. B. pseudomallei mutants lacking either the type III secreted guanine nucleotide exchange factor BopE or the putative effectors BopA or BopB exhibited varying degrees of attenuation, with mutations in bopA and bopB causing a significant delay in median time to death. This indicates that bsa-encoded type III secreted proteins may act in concert to determine the outcome of B. pseudomallei infection in mice. Mice inoculated with the B. pseudomallei bipD mutant were partially protected against subsequent challenge with wild-type B. pseudomallei. However, immunization of mice with purified BipD protein was not protective.",valid,

37626242,"The identification of highly toxic metals like Cd, Ni, Pb, Cr, Co or Cu in ambient particulate matter (PM) has garnered a lot of interest recently. Exposure to toxic metals, including carcinogenic ones, at levels above recommended limits, can significantly affect human health. Prolonged exposure to even trace amounts of toxic or essential metals can also have negative health impacts. In order to assess significant risks, it is crucial to govern the concentrations of bioavailable/bio-accessible metals that are available in PM. Estimating the total metal concentrations in PM is only an approximation of metal toxicity. This review provides an overview of various procedures for extracting soluble toxic metals from PM and the importance of chemical fractionation in risk assessment. It is observed that the environmental risk indices such as bioavailability index (BI), contamination factor (CF) and risk assessment code (RAC) are specifically influenced by the concentration of these metals in a particular fraction. Additionally, there is compelling evidence that health risks assessed using total metal concentrations may be overestimated, therefore, the metal toxicity assessment is more accurate and more sensitive to the concentration of the bioavailable/bio-accessible fraction than the total metal concentrations. Hence, chemical fractionation of toxic metals can serve as an effective tool for developing environmental protection laws and improving air quality monitoring programs for public health.",valid,

NaIO(4) can oxidize Rh 6G, which makes the RTP signal quench. Terbutaline sulfate (TBS) can inhibit NaIO(4) from oxidizing Rh 6G, which makes the RTP signal of Rh 6G enhance sharply. The content of TBS is linear correlation to DeltaIp of the system. Based on the facts above, a new inhibition solid substrate-room temperature phosphorimetry (SS-RTP) for the determination of trace TBS has been established. The linear range of this method is 0.0104-2.08 pg spot(-1) (corresponding concentration: 0.026-5.2 ng ml(-1), with a sample volume of 0.4 microl) with a detection limit (L.D.) of 2.6 fg spot(-1) (corresponding concentration: 6.5 x 10(-12) g ml(-1)), and the regression equation of working curve is DeltaIp = 2.040 + 54.54 m(TBS) (pg spot(-1)), n = 6, correlation coefficient is 0.9994.

38159554,"Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is commonly observed in atherosclerotic plaques, which is a pathogenic factor for severe coronary artery disease (CAD). The phenotype changes of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are found to participate in CAC progression, which is mainly induced by vascular inflammation and oxidative stress (OS). HMGB1, a critical inflammatory cytokine, is recently reported to induce arterial calcification, which is regulated by the Caspase-3/gasdermin-E (GSDME) axis. However, the function of the Caspase-3/GSDME axis in CAC is unknown. Herein, the involvement of the Caspase-3/GSDME axis in CAC was studied to explore the possible targets for CAC. CAC model was constructed in mice, which was verified by red cytoplasm in coronary artery tissues, increased macrophage infiltration, aggravated inflammation, and enhanced RAGE signaling, accompanied by an increased release of HMGB1 and an activated Caspase-3/ GSDME axis. In β-GP-treated MOVAS-1 cells, calcification, the ROS accumulation, enhanced LDH and HMGB1 release, enlarged macrophage production, aggravated inflammation, and activated RAGE signaling were observed, which were markedly abolished by the transfection of si-HMGB1 and si-GSDME. Moreover, the calcification deposition, the activity of Caspase-3/ GSDME axis, release of HMGB1, macrophage infiltration, cytokine production, and RAGE signaling in CAC mice were notably alleviated by VSMCs-specific GSDME knockdown, not by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)-specific GSDME knockdown.

21858817,"The adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A) R) is a potential drug target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders. In rodents, the therapeutic efficacy of A(2A) R modulation is improved by concomitant modulation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). To elucidate the anatomical substrate(s) through which these therapeutic benefits could be mediated, pre-embedding electron microscopy immunohistochemistry was used to conduct a detailed, quantitative ultrastructural analysis of A(2A) R localization in the primate basal ganglia and to assess the degree of A(2A) R/mGluR5 colocalization in the striatum. A(2A) R immunoreactivity was found at the highest levels in the striatum and external globus pallidus (GPe). However, the monkey, but not the rat, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) also harbored a significant level of neuropil A(2A) R immunoreactivity. At the electron microscopic level, striatal A(2A) R labeling was most commonly localized in postsynaptic elements (58% ± 3% of labeled elements), whereas, in the GPe and SNr, the labeling was mainly presynaptic (71% ± 5%) or glial (27% ± 6%). In both striatal and pallidal structures, putative inhibitory and excitatory terminals displayed A(2A) R immunoreactivity. Striatal A(2A) R/mGluR5 colocalization was commonly found; 60-70% of A(2A) R-immunoreactive dendrites or spines in the monkey striatum coexpress mGluR5. These findings provide the first detailed account of the ultrastructural localization of A(2A) R in the primate basal ganglia and demonstrate that A(2A) R and mGluR5 are located to interact functionally in dendrites and spines of striatal neurons. Together, these data foster a deeper understanding of the substrates through which A(2A) R could regulate primate basal ganglia function and potentially mediate its therapeutic effects in parkinsonism.",valid,3338154

Here, we investigated transcapillary transport processes on the whole-body level using the three-pore model of the capillary endothelium with large, small and ultrasmall pores. The transcapillary transport and cardiovascular response to a 4-h hemodialysis (HD) with 2 L ultrafiltration were analyzed by simulations in a virtual patient using the three-pore model of the capillary wall integrated in the whole-body compartmental model of the cardiovascular system with baroreflex mechanisms. The three-pore model revealed substantial changes during HD in the magnitude and direction of transcapillary water flows through small and ultrasmall pores and associated changes in the transcapillary convective transport of proteins and small solutes. The fraction of total capillary hydraulic conductivity attributed to ultrasmall pores was found to play an important role in the transcapillary water transport during HD thus influencing the cardiovascular response to HD.

Synaptic endings on skeletal muscles were bulbous. Most synaptic boutons simply made contact with muscle fibers, but some boutons appeared as concave invaginations into the sarcolemma. In the neuritic bundles, numerous varicosities were observed. Close approximations were found between the synaptic boutons and skeletal muscles and between the varicosities and neurites (dendrites or axons), but no membrane thickening nor subsynaptic infolding was observed in either synapse; in our cultures the contacts were characteristic of the autonomic nervous system. In both synapses, three variations were demonstrated by KMnO4 fixation after 5-hydroxydopamine incubation: (i) containing predominantly small dense-core vesicles (noradrenergic type), (ii) predominantly small clear vesicles (cholinergic types), and (iii) a mixture of both small dense-core and small clear vesicles (mixed type). Cytochemically, the varicosities in the neuritic bundles were predominantly noradrenergic at 1 week in culture, and both the synaptic boutons on skeletal muscles and the varicosities in the neuritic bundles contained a mixed population of small dense-core and small clear vesicles at intermediate times, with a gradual shift to cholinergic characteristics. These findings strongly suggest that in this culture system some sympathetic neurons or fibers become cholinergic (neuronal plasticity).",valid,

Incorporation of phosphorylcholine-(32)P into lecithin by homogenates prepared from livers of CCl(4)-treated animals was reduced, but conversion of CDP-choline-(32)P to lecithin by the isolated microsomal fraction did not show any significant depression. A block in the synthesis of CDP-choline is indicated. The in vivo utilization of methionine for lecithin synthesis was not affected. After intravenous injection of palmitic acid-1-(14)C, radioactivity of triglycerides from microsomal and mitochondrial fractions was markedly lower than the controls, whereas radioactivity of triglycerides in the soluble fraction was greatly increased. Radioactivity of diglycerides changed from 0.5% of total lipids in the control to 10% of total lipids in CCl(4)-treated animals. Incorporation of palmitic acid into phospholipids was also suppressed.

Vimentin (VIM) and E-cadherin (E-cad) are molecular markers that play important roles in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which has been shown to be correlated with tumor progression. Herein, we investigated the associations between clinicopathological parameters and VIM/E-cad expression in primary T1 stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Real-time PCR was performed on RNA extracted from tumor tissue isolated from 54 patients with T1 stage NSCLC. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure the protein levels of VIM and E-cad. The paired-samples t-test, independent-samples t- test, Kappa test, and nonparametric test were used to perform statistical analyses. The expression of VIM were lower (P<0.001) and that of E-cad was higher (P<0.001) in tumor tissue when compared with the normal tissue at the transcriptional level. The RNA of VIM in adenocarcinomas was significantly higher than that found in squamous cell carcinomas (P<0.01). Moreover, the level of metastasis observed in the lymph node was significantly higher than that observed in metastasis outside of the lymph node (P<0.05). Vimentin protein had a lower profile in the tumor tissue, and the protein level of E-cad was higher in the tumor tissue. The IHC score of VIM in tumor tissue was found associated with both the pathological type and smoke index, and the score of E-cad was found to be related to visceral pleura involvement. In conclusions, VIM is downregulated and E-cad is upregulated in T1 stage NSCLC. Our study results suggest that a mesenchymal-epithelial transition may take place in the early-stage of tumor development, and that EMT occurs when the tumor develops into a certain stage.",valid,

Formation of these seven-membered carbocycles is a domino process that comprises three consecutive reactions. The first one is a polar Diels-Alder reaction that is initialized by the nucleophilic attack of Cp to the beta-conjugated position of acrolein, yielding the formation of the endo and exo [4 + 2] cycloadducts. The corresponding LA-[4 + 2] cycloadduct complexes equilibrate through a skeleton rearrangement with a low free activation energy with two seven-membered zwitterionic intermediates, which undergo a rapid intramolecular hydride shift to yield irreversibly the formally endo and exo [4 + 3] cycloadducts.

17589384,"One of the clinical characteristics associated with septic shock is heart failure. Several lines of evidence indicate that functional consequences of heart failure in septic shock are linked to the activated NO-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) pathway. We have previously shown that the high-affinity cGMP export transporter, multidrug resistance protein 5 (MRP5), is expressed in the heart, which modulates intracellular concentrations and, hence, the effects of cGMP. Thus, modified expression of cardiac MRP5 in septic shock can alter cGMP concentrations and contribute to the development of heart failure. We therefore investigated MRP5 expression in the heart using two established murine models of septic shock (intraperitoneal LPS injection and surgical implantation of a stent into the ascending colon, resulting in a multibacterial peritonitis [CASP, colon ascendens stent peritonitis] in C57BL/6N mice, respectively; n = 38). Cardiac MRP5 was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence. The protein was localized in the endothelial wall, smooth muscle, and cardiac myocytes. MRP5 mRNA expression was significantly reduced compared with controls both in the LPS (31.9 +/- 16.8 x 10(-4) vs. 54.1 +/- 14.8 x 10(-4), P = 0.025) and CASP model (18.3 +/- 9.4 x 10(-4) vs. 42.8 +/- 12.1 x 10(-4), P = 0.009; MRP5/glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase copy numbers, respectively). In parallel, IL-6 plasma levels were significantly increased in both models. Incubation of cultured murine cardiomyocytes (HL1) with 5 ng/mL IL-6 resulted in decreased expression of MRP5 (54% of control), as did incubation of the cells with serum from septic mice (LPS serum, 22% of control; CASP serum, 11% of control). In conclusion, cardiac expression of the cGMP export transporter MRP5 is decreased in two murine models of septic shock, most likely by a transcriptional mechanism.

As experience in using ibrutinib increased, the first drug to be licensed in its class, atrial fibrillation (AF) emerged as an important side effect. The intersection between BTKi therapy for B-cell malignancies and AF represents a complex area of management with scant evidence for guidance. Consideration needs to be taken regarding the interplay of increased bleeding risk versus thromboembolic complications of AF, drug interactions between ibrutinib and anticoagulants and antiarrhythmic agents, and the potential for other, as yet seldom reported cardiac side effects. This review describes the current knowledge regarding BTKi and potential pathophysiologic mechanisms of AF and discusses the management of BTKi-associated AF. Finally, a review of the second generation BTKi is provided and gaps in knowledge in this evolving field are highlighted.",valid,

24134823,"As a basis for sodium reduction in bread, the kinetics of sodium release from wheat bread crumb during chewing was investigated by three independent methods using two in-mouth techniques and a model mastication simulator, respectively. Complete sodium extraction in-mouth was achieved after 30 s. Using coarse-grained NaCl in breadmaking significantly accelerated sodium release and led to enhanced salt taste, allowing a sodium reduction in bread by 25% while maintaining taste quality. This salt taste enhancement by accelerated sodium delivery can be explained by the increasing contrast in sodium concentration, which is known to determine salt taste perception. For the first time, the resulting inhomogeneous salt distribution in bread prepared by using coarse-grained NaCl was visualized by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy using a sodium-selective, fluorescent dye.",valid,

Here we study this formalism through a statistical mechanics approach, that is, with an auxiliary counting process that maximizes an entropy function associated with the thermodynamic potential. We show that the realizations of this auxiliary process can be obtained after applying a conditional measurement scheme to the original ones, providing is this way an alternative measurement interpretation of the thermodynamic approach. General results are obtained for renewal counting processes, that is, those where the time intervals between consecutive events are independent and defined by a unique waiting time distribution. The underlying statistical mechanics is controlled by the same waiting time distribution, rescaled by an exponential decay measured by the free energy function. A scale invariance, shift closure, and intermittence phenomena are obtained and interpreted in this context. Similar conclusions apply for nonrenewal processes when the memory between successive events is induced by a stochastic waiting time distribution.",valid,
29416533,"Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) is a common long-term complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The objective of our study was to compare the metabolic profiles for allotransplant recipients and thereby identify metabolic characteristics of patients with treatment-requiring cGVHD. The study included 51 consecutive patients (29 men and 22 women; median age: 44 years, range: 15-66 years) transplanted with peripheral blood stem cells derived from human leukocyte antigen-matched family donors. All serum samples investigated by global metabolomic profiling were collected approximately 1 year posttransplant (median 358 days). Thirty-one of the 51 patients (61%) had cGVHD 1 year posttransplant. The affected organs were (number of patients) liver/bile duct (23), eyes (15), gastrointestinal tract (14), skin (13), mouth (10), lungs (3), and urogenital tract (1). We compared the metabolic profile for patients with and without cGVHD, and a Random Forrest Classification Analysis then resulted in 75% accuracy in differentiating the two groups. The 30 top-ranked metabolites from this comparison included increased levels of bile acids, several metabolites from the cytokine-responsive kynurenine pathway for tryptophan degradation, pro-inflammatory lipid metabolites, phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolites derived from the gut microbial flora, and metabolites reflecting increased oxidative stress. However, nine of these 30 top-ranked metabolites were probably altered due to cyclosporine or steroid treatment, and we therefore did a hierarchical clustering analysis including all 51 patients but only based on the other 21 cGVHD-specific metabolites. This analysis identified three patient subsets: one cluster included mainly patients without cGVHD and had generally low metabolite levels; another cluster included mainly patients with cGVHD (most patients with at least three affected organs) and high metabolite levels, and the last intermediate group including cGVHD patients with limited organ involvement. We conclude that allotransplant recipients with cGVHD have an altered metabolic profile caused both by the disease and its immunosuppressive treatment.",valid,5787552

Whereas platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling is critical for this process during embryonic development, its role from the postnatal stages through adulthood remains unclear. We investigated the potential role of PDGF signaling during microvessel assembly by measuring in vivo the migration of labeled fibroblasts to PDGF in mesenteric connective tissue and by examining PDGF-B and PDGF receptor-beta (PGDFR-beta) expression in microvascular networks during normal maturation. PDGF-B homodimer (PDGF-BB; 30 ng/ml) application elicited a significant (P < 0.05) increase (7.8 +/- 4.1 cells) in labeled fibroblasts within 100 microm of the source micropipette after 2 h. PDGF-A homodimer (30 ng/ml) application and control solution did not elicit directed migration. PDGF-B was expressed in microvessel endothelium and smooth muscle, whereas PDGFR-beta was expressed in endothelium, smooth muscle, and interstitial fibroblasts. Given that PDGF-BB elicits fibroblast migration in the mesentery and that PDGF-B and PDGFR-beta are expressed in a pattern that indicates paracrine signaling from microvessels to the interstitium, the results are consistent with a role for PDGF-B in perivascular cell recruitment to microvessels.",valid,

35488026,"Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm (SITA) Faster is the most recent and fastest testing algorithm for the evaluation of Humphrey visual fields (VF). However, existing evidence suggests that there are some differences in global measures of VF loss in eyes transitioning from SITA Standard to the newer SITA Faster. These differences may be relevant, especially in glaucoma, where VF changes over time influence clinical decisions around treatment. Furthermore, characterization of differences in localizable VF loss patterns between algorithms, rather than global summary measures, can be important for clinician interpretation when transitioning testing strategies. In this study, we determined the effect of transitioning from SITA Standard to SITA Faster on VF loss patterns in glaucomatous eyes undergoing longitudinal VF testing in a real-world clinical setting. Archetypal analysis was used to derive composition weights of 16 clinically relevant VF patterns (i.e., archetypes (AT)) from patient VFs. We found switching from SITA Standard to SITA Faster was associated with less preservation of VF loss (i.e., abnormal AT 2-4, 6-9, 11, 13, 14) relative to successive SITA Standard exams (P value < 0.01) and was associated with relatively greater preservation of AT 1, the normal VF (P value < 0.01).

Daily administration of 20 to 60 mg amosulalol caused a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure within 2 weeks. This effect was stable, lasting for the entire trial period. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased from 174 +/- 13/92 +/- 9 mmHg at the beginning to 148 +/- 16/80 +/- 11 mmHg at the end of the trial. Heart rate was not affected. Plasma glucose and haemoglobin Alc levels showed a tendency to decrease without any statistical significance. Total and HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels also remained unchanged.

The response rates for 102 patients in chronic phase were: complete hematologic, 94.1%; complete cytogenetic, 69.6%; and complete molecular response, 54.9%. For 14 patients in the accelerated phase, the respective response rates were 85.7, 35.7 and 28.6%. The 3-year progression-free survival and 5-year overall survival were 73.3 and 74.8%. Although skin hypopigmentation occurs as the most common side effect (77.6%), imatinib is still well tolerated. In addition to the known pretreatment characteristics of spleen size, leukocyte and platelet counts, disease phase and Sokal scores, we found that delayed therapy, variant Philadelphia chromosome translocations and IM-related grade 3/4 leucopenia were associated with an inferior cytogenetic response. Four factors emerged as predictors of disease progression: molecular response, cytogenetic response, disease phase and disease duration prior to imatinib treatment, but only the latter three remained significant after multivariate analysis. The results indicate that the suboptimal outcome in Chinese patients is associated with delayed imatinib therapy, so the importance of the optimal treatment opportunity for CML should be emphasized.",valid,

Furthermore, prevention of pollen dispersal also answers to concerns regarding transgene flow via pollen from Genetically Modified (GM) crops to traditional crop fields or wild relatives. We induced male sterility by suppressing endogenous general transcription factor genes, TAFs, using anther-specific promoters combined with artificial microRNA (amiRNA) technology (Schwab et al., 2006). The system was made reversible by the ethanol inducible expression of an amiRNA-insensitive form of the target gene. We provide proof of concept in eggplant, a cultivated crop belonging to the Solanaceae family that includes many important food crops. The transgenic eggplants that we generated are completely male sterile and fertility can be fully restored by short treatments with ethanol, confirming the efficiency but also the reliability of the system in view of open field cultivation.

26844618,"Follicular unit transplantation is the most commonly performed technique in modern restorative hair transplantation surgery. It relies on the acquisition of intact follicular units from microdissected scalp skin strips and their subsequent transplantation into the recipient regions affected by alopecia. Ideally, the translocation of follicular units from the balding-resistant areas of the scalp (usually the occipital region) to the recipient site should not result in any morphological change in the grafts. Nevertheless, the insults associated with surgical intervention present grafted follicles to mechanical and chemical cues differently from those of the physiological steady-state conditions in undamaged skin. This disruption of the normal follicular microenvironment might alter important aspects of hair biology in grafts, for example, hair cycle and pigmentation, and, in turn, could lead to differences in hair appearance, eventually culminating in a diminished esthetical outcome of the surgery. In this study, the authors analyzed native and grafted scalp hair follicles (HFs) from 2 patients who had undergone follicular unit transplantation surgeries formerly. Scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy-based histomorphometry revealed a marked enlargement of follicular structures in the grafts with a concomitant increase in hair shaft diameter. Immunohistological staining confirmed a thickening of the dermal sheath in transplanted HFs that also harbored a denser vascular network. Taken together, these results show that the grafted HFs analyzed were subjected to marked morphological changes during their residence in the recipient site and that this phenomenon is associated with a modulation of follicular vascularization.",valid,

Aortic input impedance consists of the characteristic impedance (index of aortic distensibility) and the terminal impedance (index of peripheral resistance) which represent the left ventricular hydraulic load. The external left ventricular hydraulic power consists of steady power which transmits blood to the peripheral vasculature and pulsatile power which is converted into heat energy. The ratio of pulsatile to total power indicates the efficiency of the arterial system. The present study was carried out on 6 patients with VSD whose Qp/Qs was greater than 2.0 (VSD group) and 10 age-matched controls who had a history of Kawasaki disease without coronary complications at the time of cardiac catheterization (control group). Descending aortic pressure and flow velocity were measured simultaneously at the level of the 10th thoracic vertebra using a multisensor-catheter. Impedance data were calculated from Fourier analysis of these findings. Characteristic impedance did not differ between the 2 groups. Terminal impedance was higher in the VSD group with the increasing peripheral resistance and vascular afterload. The pulsatile component of external hydraulic power was similar in both groups, however, the steady component was lower in the VSD group indicating a higher ratio of pulsatile to total power in the VSD group. In conclusion, vascular afterload was increased and the efficiency of the arterial system was reduced in patients with VSD having large shunts.",valid,

A U-rich sequence within the 5' untranslated region of the psbD mRNA has previously been shown to be required for its translation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. By using UV cross-linking assays, we have identified a 40-kDa RNA binding protein, which binds to the wild-type psbD leader, but is unable to recognize a nonfunctional leader mutant lacking the U-rich motif. RNA binding is restored in a chloroplast cis-acting suppressor. The functions of several site-directed psbD leader mutants were analyzed with transgenic C. reinhardtii chloroplasts and the in vitro RNA binding assay. A clear correlation between photosynthetic activity and the capability to bind RNA by the 40-kDa protein was observed. Furthermore, the data obtained suggest that the poly(U) region serves as a molecular spacer between two previously characterized cis-acting elements, which are involved in RNA stabilization and translation. RNA-protein complex formation depends on the nuclear Nac2 gene product that is part of a protein complex required for the stabilization of the psbD mRNA. The sedimentation properties of the 40-kDa RNA binding protein suggest that it interacts directly with this Nac2 complex and, as a result, links processes of chloroplast RNA metabolism and translation.",valid,86423

In this study, the change in nutrient metabolism between the 2-cell and blastocyst stages was followed by measuring single embryo concentrations of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glycolytic metabolites with microfluorometric enzymatic cycling assays. When the normal values were established, further changes that occur as a result of the induction of apoptosis by exposure to high-glucose conditions were examined. From the 2-cell to the blastocyst stage, the embryos experienced an increase in TCA metabolites and a dramatic increase in fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). The high TCA metabolites may result from accumulation of substrate due to a slowing of TCA cycle metabolism as glycolysis predominates. Embryos exposed to elevated glucose conditions experienced significantly lower FBP, suggesting decreased glycolysis, significantly higher pyruvate, suggesting increased pyruvate uptake by the embryos in response to decreased glycolysis, and increased TCA metabolites, suggesting an inability to oxidize the pyruvate and a slowing of the TCA cycle. We speculate that the glycolytic changes lead to dysfunction of the outer mitochondrial membrane that results in the abnormal TCA metabolite pattern and triggers the apoptotic event.",valid,

For modal completion (aka subjective contours), Kanizsa figures were constructed using black 'pac-men' to form regular polygons on colored paper. For amodal completion, portions of variously colored regular 2D polygons were occluded by black circles or other black figures. For each task, Griffin provided a vocal English shape label for five possible shapes designated by their vertices (one, two, three, four, six). His accuracy was high for both amodal completed figures, including probe stimuli (28/38 correct) and modally completed figures (29/38 correct), with chance=0.20. The modally completed case (i.e., Kanizsa subjective figures) is of particular importance as there are no shared image parts between training and testing stimuli. We draw several conclusions from these results. First, a surface level completion process is fully operative insofar as Griffin was able to correctly identify shapes that differed considerably from training images. Second, because parrots can generalize from shapes of real objects to drawings where original image contours were clearly absent, the data provide a compelling example of shape invariance, indicating that visual shapes are processed far beyond that of their image description. Third, parrots with a repertoire of multiple vocal responses can be rigorously tested for visual competencies, an option as yet to be tried in other experimental animals.",valid,

In mammals, a master circadian clock exists in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, and slave oscillators can be found in most tissues. These circadian oscillations are controlled by ""clock genes"". The negative feedback loop is thought to function as a molecular mechanism of the circadian clock. It is plausible that clock genes may control lipid metabolism through so-called clock-controlled genes and that lipid metabolism-related clock-controlled genes may play important roles in the circadian change of lipid metabolism. Recently research has focused on the relationships between the clock system and lipid metabolism. In this review, we discuss the following items: 1) circadian clock system, 2) effect of the diet on clock gene expression, 3) effect of clock mutation on lipid metabolism, and 4) effect of streptozotocin-induced diabetes and ob mutation on clock gene expression and lipid metabolism.

Further experiments are needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism of interaction between clock genes and lipid metabolisms.",valid,
15053625,"Previously, we have shown that the ferryl ion ([FeIVO]2+) is easily produced from Fenton's reagent (i.e., a mixture of Fe2+ ions and H2O2 in aqueous solution), using DFT and Car-Parrinello MD calculations. To verify that the ferryl ion can indeed act as the active species in oxidation reactions with Fenton's reagent, we study in the present paper the reactivity of the ferryl ion toward an organic substrate, in particular the oxidation of methane to methanol. In the first part of this paper, we perform static DFT calculations on the reaction of CH4 with the [(H2O)5FeIVO]2+ complex in vacuo that show a strong prevalence of the oxygen-rebound mechanism over the methane coordination mechanism. This is in agreement with the static DFT results for methane oxidation by biocatalysts MMO and P450, but not with those for methane oxidation by bare metal-oxo ions, where the methane coordination mechanism prevails. The highest energy barrier in the oxygen-rebound mechanism is only 3 kcal/mol in vacuo, whereas in the methane coordination mechanism the highest barrier is 23 kcal/mol. Overall the oxidation reaction energy is downhill by 47 kcal/mol. We conclude that the ferryl ion can indeed act as the oxidative intermediate in the Fenton oxidation of organic species. In the second part of this paper, we perform a preliminary assessment of solvent effects on the oxidation by the ferryl ion in aqueous solution using the method of constrained (first principles) molecular dynamics. The free energy barrier of the H-abstraction reaction from methane by the ferryl ion (i.e., the first step in the rebound mechanism) in aqueous solution is, with 22 kcal/mol in solution, significantly higher than in vacuo. Given the fact that methane has a relatively strong C-H bond (ca. 10 kcal/mol stronger than the C-H bonds in the more typical Fenton's reagent substrates), we infer that for many organic substrates oxidation with the ferryl ion as an active intermediate may be a perfectly viable route.",valid,

The need to regenerate or repair the damaged heart muscle has not been met by adult stem cell therapy, either endogenous or via cell delivery. The genetically stable human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have unlimited expansion ability and unrestricted plasticity, proffering a pluripotent reservoir for in vitro derivation of large supplies of human somatic cells that are restricted to the lineage in need of repair and regeneration. Due to the prevalence of cardiovascular disease worldwide and acute shortage of donor organs, there is intense interest in developing hESC-based therapies as an alternative approach. However, how to channel the wide differentiation potential of pluripotent hESCs efficiently and predictably to a desired phenotype has been a major challenge for both developmental study and clinical translation. Conventional approaches rely on multi-lineage inclination of pluripotent cells through spontaneous germ layer differentiation, resulting in inefficient and uncontrollable lineage-commitment that is often followed by phenotypic heterogeneity and instability, hence, a high risk of tumorigenicity (see a schematic in Fig. 1A). In addition, undefined foreign/animal biological supplements and/or feeders that have typically been used for the isolation, expansion, and differentiation of hESCs may make direct use of such cell-specialized grafts in patients problematic. To overcome these obstacles, we have resolved the elements of a defined culture system necessary and sufficient for sustaining the epiblast pluripotence of hESCs, serving as a platform for de novo derivation of clinically-suitable hESCs and effectively directing such hESCs uniformly towards clinically-relevant lineages by small molecules (see a schematic in Fig. 1B). After screening a variety of small molecules and growth factors, we found that such defined conditions rendered nicotinamide (NAM) sufficient to induce the specification of cardiomesoderm direct from pluripotent hESCs that further progressed to cardioblasts that generated human beating cardiomyocytes with high efficiency (Fig. 2). We defined conditions for induction of cardioblasts direct from pluripotent hESCs without an intervening multi-lineage embryoid body stage, enabling well-controlled efficient derivation of a large supply of human cardiac cells across the spectrum of developmental stages for cell-based therapeutics.",valid,3308594
22643005,"The spermatozoon is one of the most differentiated cells in mammals and its production requires an extremely complex machinery. Subtle but critical molecular changes take place during capacitation, which comprises the last series of maturation steps that naturally occur between the cauda epididymidis where spermatozoa are stored and their ultimate destination inside the oocyte. Phospholipases, by hydrolyzing various phospholipids, have been found to be critical in sperm processes such as 1) the control of flagellum beats, 2) capacitation - the molecular transformations preparing the sperm for fertilization, 3) acrosome reaction and 4) oocyte activation by eliciting calcium oscillations. The emerging important role of phospholipases is also emphasized by the fact that alterations of sperm lipids can lead to infertility. Phospholipases may represent valuable targets to develop anti- and pro-fertility drugs. Results obtained in mice are encouraging, since treatment of sperm with recombinant sPLA(2) of group X, known to be involved in capacitation, improves fertilization in vitro, while co-injection of PLCζ RNA with infertile sperm restores oocyte activation.",valid,

24376784,"Eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, both spontaneous and treatment-induced, is marked by the wildtype allele C of a single nucleotide polymorphism upstream of the IL28B gene, rs12979860. This favorable allele was recently described to be in linkage disequilibrium with the wildtype allele TT of a dinucleotide polymorphism, ss469415590, located within a new protein-coding gene. While the TT allele introduces a frame-shift and disrupts the open reading frame, only the variant allele, ΔG, creates a novel type III interferon (IFN) protein, IFN-λ4/IFNL4. Absence of IFNL4 is thus supposed to favor resolution of HCV infection. As to date IFNL4 mRNA transcription has only been investigated in polyI:C-stimulated primary human hepatocytes and not yet in HCV infection in vivo, this study analyzed IFNL4 mRNA expression in human liver biopsy specimens. Samples were obtained from patients with a broad panel of disorders including no liver disease, liver diseases of non-viral etiology, chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C. Hepatic IFNL4 transcripts were detectable exclusively in a subgroup of chronic hepatitis C patients (24/45). Their amounts were positively related to liver HCV RNA copy numbers (p = 0.0023, r = 0.56) suggesting that the hepatic viral load influences IFNL4 transcription irrespective of IFNL4 governing genotype. Both, the IFNL4 creating allele ΔG (p<0.0001) and actual IFNL4 transcription (p = 0.0015) were found to be correlated to the activation of IFN stimulatory genes (ISGs). By contrast, IFNL4 ss469415590 genotypes were not found to be related to IFN-λ2/3/IL28 or IFN-λ1/IL29 gene expression. In conclusion, this study is the first report on intrahepatic transcript levels of the recently discovered IFNL4 gene. Data indicate that HCV infection in particular might activate IFNL4 transcription in the liver. It provides a possible explanation as to why hepatitis C patients show ISG stimulation in their livers in the apparent absence of an induction of other IFN subtypes.",valid,3869873
22232611,"The mechanisms underlying vocal mimicry in animals remain an open question. Delphinidae are able to copy sounds from their environment that are not produced by conspecifics. Usually, these mimicries occur associated with the context in which they were learned. No reports address the question of separation between auditory memory formation and spontaneous vocal copying although the sensory and motor phases of vocal learning are separated in a variety of songbirds. Here we show that captive bottlenose dolphins produce, during their nighttime resting periods, non-dolphin sounds that they heard during performance shows. Generally, in the middle of the night, these animals produced vocal copies of whale sounds that had been broadcast during daily public shows. As their life history was fully known, we know that these captive dolphins had never had the opportunity to hear whale sounds before then. Moreover, recordings made before the whale sounds started being broadcast revealed that they had never emitted such sounds before. This is to our knowledge the first evidence for a separation between formation of auditory memories and the process of learning to produce calls that match these memories in a marine mammal. One hypothesis is that dolphins may rehearse some special events heard during the daytime and that they then express vocally what could be conceived as a more global memory. These results open the way for broader views on how animals might rehearse life events while resting or maybe dreaming.",valid,3247700

We previously showed that increasing maternal obesity is associated with significant reductions in placental mitochondrial respiration. MicroRNA (miR)-143 has been previously shown to regulate the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis in cancer tissues. We hypothesized that mitochondrial respiration is reduced and aerobic glycolysis is up-regulated via changes in miR-143 expression in the placenta of women with GDM. Placental tissue was collected at term from women with A1GDM (controlled by diet), A2GDM (controlled by medication) and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls (CTRL). miR-143 expression was measured by RT-PCR. Expression of mitochondrial complexes, transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator 1α (PGC1α) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), components of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling, glucose transporter GLUT1 and glycolytic enzymes [hexokinase-2 (HK-2), phosphofructokinase (PFK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] were measured by Western blot. Trophoblast respiration was measured by XF24 Analyser. Expression of miR-143, mitochondrial complexes, and PPARγ and PGC1α, which act downstream of miR-143, were significantly decreased in A2GDM placentae compared with A1GDM and CTRL (P<0.01). Placental hPL (human placental lactogen) levels, expression of glycolytic enzymes, GLUT1 and mTOR signalling were also significantly increased by more than 2-fold in A2GDM compared with A1GDM and CTRL (P<0.05). There was a 50% reduction in mitochondrial respiration in trophoblast cells isolated from A2GDM placentae. Overexpression of miR-143 was able to increase mitochondrial respiration, increase protein expression of mitochondrial complexes and decrease expression of glycolytic enzymes by 40% compared with A2GDM.

This study investigates the action of Te on immunity acquired against blood-stages of the malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi in female mice of the inbred strain C57BL/10. Our data show: (i) About 90% of mice infected with 10(6) P. chabaudi-infected erythrocytes are able to develop protective immune mechanisms which become evident in self-healing the infection. The capability of self-healing is lost when mice are pretreated with Te for 3 weeks. (ii) Mice which have self-healed infections acquire immunity to homologous rechallenge. Concomitantly, mice become Te-unresponsive in that their acquired immunity is not suppressible by Te-treatment. (iii) Flow cytometry reveals that Te-pretreatment entails an increase of CD8+ cells and a decrease of Ig+ cells by about 4% in spleens of non-immune mice. In immune mice, however, there is a Te-unresponsiveness of the percental distribution of splenic cell populations. (iv) Adoptive transfer experiments indicate that immunity is conferred by spleen cells, presumably non-T-cells. These cells are Te-unresponsive, since they exert their effect in Te-pretreated mice in the presence of Te. (v) Te-unresponsive immunity can be also transferred by serum, especially the IgG-fraction, obtained from immune mice. Our data demonstrate that Te prevents the development of protective immunity against P. chabaudi infections. However, when once established, protective immunity becomes unresponsive to Te. Our data suggest that the effector mechanisms of protective immunity involve Te-unresponsive B cells secreting protective IgG-antibodies.",valid,

31189975,"Glucocorticoids (Gcs) are widely prescribed anti-inflammatory compounds, which act through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Using an unbiased proteomics screen in lung tissue, we identified the membrane protein caveolin -1 (Cav1) as a direct interaction partner of the GR. In Cav1 knockout mice GR transactivates anti-inflammatory genes, including Dusp1, more than in controls. We therefore determined the role of Cav1 in modulating Gc action in two models of pulmonary inflammation. We first tested innate responses in lung. Loss of Cav1 impaired the inflammatory response to nebulized LPS, increasing cytokine/chemokine secretion from lung, but impairing neutrophil infiltration. Despite these changes to the inflammatory response, there was no Cav1 effect on anti-inflammatory capacity of Gcs. We also tested GR/Cav1 crosstalk in a model of allergic airway inflammation. Cav1 had a very mild effect on the inflammatory response, but no effect on the Gc response - with comparable immune cell infiltrate (macrophage, eosinophils, neutrophils), pathological score and PAS positive cells observed between both genotypes. Pursuing the Th2 adaptive immune response further we demonstrate that Cav1 knockout mice retained their ability to expel the intestinal nematode parasite T.muris, which requires adaptive Th2 immune response for elimination. Therefore, Cav1 regulates innate immune responses in the lung, but does not have an effect on Th2-mediated adaptive immunity in lung or gut. Although we demonstrate that Cav1 regulates GR transactivation of anti-inflammatory genes, this does not translate to an effect on suppression of inflammation in vivo.",valid,6562044

The number of mature and immature platelets, platelet life span, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation response, and light/dye-induced thrombus formation in cremaster muscle arterioles were measured in wild-type (WT) and IL-6-deficient (IL-6(-/-)) mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. DSS colitis in WT mice was associated with thrombocytosis with an elevated number of both mature and immature platelets and no change in platelet life span. The thrombocytosis response was absent in IL-6(-/-) mice. DSS treatment also enhanced the platelet aggregation response to thrombin and accelerated thrombus development in WT mice, but not in IL-6(-/-) mice. Exogenous IL-6 administered to WT mice elicited a dose-dependent enhancement of thrombus formation. These findings indicate that IL-6 mediates the thrombocytosis, platelet hyperreactivity, and accelerated thrombus development associated with experimental colitis.

The inheritance of this resistance was studied in an F(2) population derived from a cross of this accession with an Indonesian hot pepper variety ( Capsicum annuum) using a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approach. In laboratory tests where ripe fruits were artificially inoculated with either C. gloeosporioides or C. capsici, three resistance-related traits were scored: the infection frequency, the true lesion diameter (averaged over all lesions that actually developed), and the overall lesion diameter (averaged over all inoculation points, including those that did not develop lesions). One main QTL was identified with highly significant and large effects on all three traits after inoculation with C. gloeosporioides and on true lesion diameter after inoculation with C. capsici. Three other QTL with smaller effects were found for overall lesion diameter and true lesion diameter after inoculation with C. gloeosporioides, two of which also had an effect on infection frequency. Interestingly, the resistant parent carried a susceptible allele for a QTL for all three traits that was closely linked to the main QTL.

These chromatin remodellers generally function by translocating along nucleosomal DNA at the H3-H4 interface of nucleosomes. Here we show that, unlike other remodellers, INO80 translocates along DNA at the H2A-H2B interface of nucleosomes and persistently displaces DNA from the surface of H2A-H2B. DNA translocation and DNA torsional strain created near the entry site of nucleosomes by INO80 promotes both the mobilization of nucleosomes and the selective exchange of H2A.Z-H2B dimers out of nucleosomes and replacement by H2A-H2B dimers without any additional histone chaperones. We find that INO80 translocates and mobilizes H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes more efficiently than those containing H2A, partially accounting for the preference of INO80 to replace H2A.Z with H2A.

22511806,"Association mapping (AM), also known as linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping, is a viable approach to overcome limitations of pedigree-based quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. In AM, genotypic and phenotypic correlations are investigated in unrelated individuals. Unlike QTL mapping, AM takes advantage of both LD and historical recombination present within the gene pool of an organism, thus utilizing a broader reference population. In plants, AM has been used in model species with available genomic resources. Pursuing AM in tree species requires both genotyping and phenotyping of large populations with unique architectures. Recently, genome sequences and genomic resources for forest and fruit crops have become available. Due to abundance of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a genome, along with availability of high-throughput resequencing methods, SNPs can be effectively used for genotyping trees. In addition to DNA polymorphisms, copy number variations (CNVs) in the form of deletions, duplications, and insertions also play major roles in control of expression of phenotypic traits. Thus, CNVs could provide yet another valuable resource, beyond those of microsatellite and SNP variations, for pursuing genomic studies. As genome-wide SNP data are generated from high-throughput sequencing efforts, these could be readily reanalysed to identify CNVs, and subsequently used for AM studies. However, forest and fruit crops possess unique architectural and biological features that ought to be taken into consideration when collecting genotyping and phenotyping data, as these will also dictate which AM strategies should be pursued.

Here, blood plasma 'total α-synuclein' and 'Ser-129 phosphorylated α-synuclein' were assayed at 4-6 monthly intervals from a cohort of 189 newly-diagnosed patients with PD. For log-transformed data, plasma total α-synuclein levels increased with time for up to 20 yrs after the appearance of initial symptoms (p = 0.012), whereas phosphorylated α-synuclein remained constant over this same period. The mean level of phosphorylated α-synuclein, but not of total α-synuclein, was higher in the PD plasma samples taken at first visit than in single samples taken from a group of 91 healthy controls (p = 0.012).

The majority of cell-attached and inside-out patches contained cationic channels with an equal permeability to Na+ and K+. Positive pressure applied through the pipette reversibly increased their open probability, whereas negative pressure reversibly decreased it. The dependence of the channel activity on pressure was sigmoidal in all tested patches. 3. The slope conductance of the channel for inward current was 33.9 +/- 2.1 pS in a nominally Ca(2+)-free extracellular solution. With 1 mM CaCl2 in the extracellular solution, the channel conductance for inward current was reduced to 21.2 +/- 2.3 pS. In isotonic CaCl2 solution, the slope conductance of the channel was 5.9 +/- 1.3 pS. The ionic permeability ratio was PCa: PNa: PK = 3.5:1:1. 4. Gadolinium and lanthanum at a concentration of 10 microM did not affect the channels, but at higher concentrations (> or = 100 microM) reduced inward currents through the channels. 5.

Because neurofilament proteins are essential for neuronal process outgrowth and differentiation, the effects of alcohol on these proteins were determined in the neuronal processes of primary cultured gestational day 18 rat hippocampal neurons. At the relatively lower concentrations used in the present study, alcohol caused a concentration-dependent reduction (< or = 47%) in 68 and 200 kDa neurofilament proteins (p < 0.05). Alcohol caused a 32% downward trend in 160 kDa neurofilament protein levels.

806523,"An immunochemical and functional analysis of the classical and alternate complement pathways in human serum was performed in the presence of 10 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and MgCl(2)-EGTA (MgEGTA), chelating agents which have been recently utilized as a means of distinguishing between these two complement pathways. Total hemolytic activity, integrity of the C1 complex, hemolytic activity of C2, conversion of factor B (C3 proactivator), and complement-dependent bactericidal activity were studied. The effect of these chelators on activation of complement pathways by Escherichia coli, by sensitized erythrocytes as a prototype of activators of the classical pathway, and by zymosan as a prototype of alternate (properdin) pathway activators was studied. Human serum containing 10 mM EGTA, which provides almost no ionized calcium and considerably less ionized magnesium than unchelated serum, allowed consumption of complement via the alternate (properdin) pathway, but blocked the classical pathway as judged by disintegration of the C1 complex and lack of utilization of C2. However, activity of the alternate complement pathway in EGTA serum, as judged by conversion of factor B and bactericidal activity against gram-negative bacteria, was distinctly suboptimal. Addition of magnesium ion in a concentration equimolar to EGTA (MgEGTA serum), while still providing conditions in which the C1 complex dissociated, significantly enhanced alternate complement pathway-mediated bactericidal activity. However, in MgEGTA serum considerable fluid-phase activation of the alternate pathway, as indicated by decrease in 50% hemolytic complement (CH(5 0)) titers and conversion of factor B to its active form in the absence of any activating challenge, was observed. Moreover, some fluid-phase consumption of C2 was observed in MgEGTA serum, even though, as mentioned, the C1 complex was shown to be dissociated under these conditions. MgEGTA-related activation of C2 and of the alternate (properdin) pathway of complement was significantly enhanced by the presence of zymosan and E. coli. These results indicate that use of the chelating agents EGTA and MgEGTA to differentiate between classical and alternate pathway activation of human complement is more complex than has hitherto been suggested. In EGTA serum, spontaneous activation of either pathway does not occur but bactericidal activity, as a measure of biologic function of complement, is suboptimal. In MgEGTA serum, bactericidal activity is fully expressed, but there is considerable instability, in terms of fluid-phase activation, in Mg(2+)-dependent components of both pathways. Thus, caution is indicated in the use and interpretation of the effects of these chelating agents on biologic functions mediated by either pathway of human complement.",valid,415205

10556205,"To date, the normal transcriptional regulation of the human beta-globin gene cluster has been recapitulated most accurately in transgenic mice that carry large yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) or ligated cosmid constructs. However, these large transgenes still exhibit variegated expression levels, perhaps because they tend to rearrange upon integration, or because the cloning vectors remain attached to the globin inserts. To try to circumvent these potential problems, we investigated the transgenic properties of a 100-kb DNA fragment containing the entire human beta-globin cluster propagated in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). We created 9 independent mouse lines, each carrying 1 to 6 copies of the human beta-globin cluster without the attached BAC vector. Five of the lines carry unrearranged copies of the cluster. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of adult F(1) mice showed that 2 lines express human beta globin at levels approximately equivalent to the endogenous mouse beta-major genes. One line expresses no human beta globin, while the remaining 6 lines show intermediate expression levels. Complete gamma-->beta-globin gene switching occurs, but is slightly delayed with respect to the endogenous mouse embryonic-->adult switch. Since these data are similar to what has been obtained using globin YACs or ligated cosmids, we conclude that (1) globin transgenes propagated in BACs are no less likely to rearrange than their cosmid or YAC counterparts, and (2) the retention of YAC vector sequences in a transgene probably has no significant impact on globin expression when using constructs of this size.",valid,

On the next day the animals were injected with colchicine, killed and mitotic figures in adrenal histological sections counted. The same treatment was given to rats 20 days after enucleation. Only the N-POMC antiserum significantly diminished adrenal mitotic activity 14 and 21 days after enucleation (P less than 0.01 and 0.05 respectively) when compared with NRS-treated enucleated rats, whereas plasma corticosterone levels in rats 14 days after enucleation were significantly (P less than 0.005) decreased only by treatment with ACTH antiserum. To determine whether the mitogenic N-POMC peptides involved in adrenal regeneration originated from the pituitary intermediate lobe, 0.9% (w/v) NaCl or ergocryptine (10 mg/kg body weight) was administered s.c. twice daily to rats between 7 and 13 days after enucleation.

Sellers typically demand at least twice as much as choosers, inconsistent with economic theory. This result is usually explained by an increased weighting of losses, or loss aversion. The authors provide a memory-based account of endowment, suggesting that people construct values by posing a series of queries whose order differs for sellers and choosers. Because of output interference, these queries retrieve different aspects of the object and the medium of exchange, producing different valuations. The authors show that the content and structure of the recalled aspects differ for selling and choosing and that these aspects predict valuations. Merely altering the order in which queries are posed can eliminate the endowment effect, and changing the order of queries can produce endowment-like effects without ownership.",valid,

Nodules fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia that is assimilated by the plant and this process requires strict metabolic regulation and signaling. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are involved as signal molecules at all stages of symbiosis, from rhizobial infection to nodule senescence. Also, reactive sulfur species (RSS) are emerging as important signals for an efficient symbiosis. Homeostasis of reactive molecules is mainly accomplished by antioxidant enzymes and metabolites and is essential to allow redox signaling while preventing oxidative damage. Here, we examine the metabolic pathways of reactive molecules and antioxidants with an emphasis on their functions in signaling and protection of symbiosis. In addition to providing an update of recent findings while paying tribute to original studies, we identify several key questions. These include the need of new methodologies to detect and quantify ROS, RNS, and RSS, avoiding potential artifacts due to their short lifetimes and tissue manipulation; the regulation of redox-active proteins by post-translational modification; the production and exchange of reactive molecules in plastids, peroxisomes, nuclei, and bacteroids; and the unknown but expected crosstalk between ROS, RNS, and RSS in nodules.",valid,9826421

This implies a direct interaction between carbohydrate and cell membrane components. To examine other mechanisms by which carbohydrate could activate post-receptor events, we have used sequence-specific and conformation-specific alpha-subunit radioimmunoassays as probes for conformational changes in deglycosylated choriogonadotropin and follitropin. Immunoreactivity of either hormone was enhanced 8-13-fold after removal of carbohydrate by anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Removal of sialic acid alone had little effect on reactivity. Based on the specificity of the antisera, the effect could be localized to a region in the amino-terminus remote in the linear sequence from actual sites of carbohydrate attachment. The results suggest that a conformational change in the alpha-subunit could account, at least in part, for the observed effects of deglycosylation on glycoprotein hormone action.",valid,
9888702,"Hepatic angiomyolipoma (AML) is frequently misdiagnosed. HMB-45 is a promising immunomarker for this tumor that leads to recognition of some AMLs with unusual morphology. The purpose of this collaborative study is to better define the morphologic variations of AML. Thirty AMLs were examined, including four biopsy specimens and two fine-needle aspirates. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of HMB-45-positive myoid cells. Almost half the cases were originally misdiagnosed as carcinomas or sarcomas. There was marked female predominance (25:5), and the mean age was 48.7 years (range 29-68). Three patients (10%) had evidence of tuberous sclerosis and all had renal AML. According to the line of differentiation and predominance of tissue components, the tumors was subcategorized into mixed, lipomatous (> or = 70% fat), myomatous (< or = 10% fat), and angiomatous type. The mixed type was the most common (11 resected cases), comprising sheets of epithelioid muscle cells admixed with islands of adipocytes, abnormal vessels, and frequently, hematopoietic cells. Six tumors (including three from biopsy specimens) were heavily fatty and showed predominantly adipocytes with epithelioid and short spindle myoid cells webbed between fat cells. Of 10 myomatous AMLs, five tumors showed a pure sinusoidal trabecular pattern and comprised mainly epithelioid cells. Typically, mature adipocytes were absent or scanty, but fat was seen as fine droplets within cytoplasm or as occasional large globules in sinusoids. Pelioid and inflammatory pseudotumor-like patterns were identified focally. Regarding cellular features of the myoid cells, most of the epithelioid cells were either eosinophilic or clear with spiderweb cell morphology. Three AMLs showed an almost purely oncocytic appearance with scanty fat. Large pleomorphic epithelioid cells existed as small foci. Spindle cells arranged in long fascicles were uncommon. D-PAS-positive globules were common around pelioid areas. Brown pigments with staining characteristics of hemosiderin and/or melanin were noted. In conclusion, we propose HMB-45-positive myoid cells as the defining criterion of hepatic AML, which is a tumor capable of dual myomatous and lipomatous differentiation and melanogenesis. Because of its protean morphologic appearance, recognition of the various variant patterns and cell types is important for a correct diagnosis, assisted by immunohistochemical confirmation with HMB-45. Trabecular and oncocytic cell tumors appear to stand out as distinctive subtypes.",valid,
27734227,"During epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), epithelial cells lose key phenotypic markers (e.g., E-cadherin and cytokeratin 18) and acquire mesenchymal markers (e.g., N-cadherin and vimentin). Although the loss of cytokeratin 18 is a hallmark of EMT, the regulatory role of cytokeratin 18 in EMT is not yet fully understood. Here, we report that cytokeratin 18 is involved in the regulation of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1)-induced EMT in breast epithelial cells. When MCF10A cells were treated with TGF-β1 for 24 h, considerable morphological changes, indicative of the early stages of EMT (e.g., loss of cell-cell contact), were observed and cytokeratin 18 was downregulated. However, E-cadherin levels were not altered until a later time point. This suggests that cytokeratin 18 may play an active role during the earlier stages of EMT. Consistent with this notion, siRNA-mediated knockdown of cytokeratin 18 delayed TGF-β1-mediated EMT, and the associated downregulation of E-cadherin reduced the phosphorylation/nuclear localization of smad 2/3 and decreased the expression levels of snail and slug (which inhibit E-cadherin expression in epithelial cells as an early response to TGF-β1). Taken together, these results suggest that cytokeratin 18 critically contributes to initiating TGF-β1-induced EMT via the smad 2/3-mediated regulation of snail and slug expression in breast epithelial cells.",valid,

In the present in vivo study we show that synthetic amidated IAPP induced impaired glucose tolerance in each of the 3 cats studied, with dramatic impairment (increases in glucose to T1/2 values of 124% and 234%) in 2 of the 3 cats.

Understanding the relationship between psychological and social factors and adolescent spinal pain may be important in both the prevention and treatment of spinal pain in this age group. We aimed to determine if psychological and social factors were associated with spinal pain in a cross-sectional study of a school-based cohort of 1279 Danish adolescents aged 11-13, who were categorized into ""any"" and ""substantial"" spinal pain. ""Substantial spinal pain"" was defined as a lifetime frequency of ""sometimes"" or ""often"" and a pain intensity of at least two on the revised Faces Pain Scale. Logistic regression analyses, stratified by sex, were conducted for single and all variables together. Eighty-six percent of participants reported ""any spinal pain"" and 28% reported ""substantial spinal pain"". Frequency of psychological and social factors was significantly higher in those with spinal pain compared to those without. As the frequency of psychological and social factors increased, the odds of both ""any spinal pain"" and ""substantial spinal pain"" also increased.Conclusion: Psychological and social factors may be important determinants in adolescent spinal pain. What is Known: • Spinal pain begins early in life to reach adult levels by age 18. Spinal pain in adolescence is strongly associated with spinal pain in adulthood. • In adults, psychological and social factors and spinal pain are strongly related; however, this relationship in adolescence is poorly understood.

However, significantly stronger functional connectivity appeared between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the right angular gyrus and the bilateral superior frontal gyrus during composition. These findings indicate that a specific brain state of musical creation is formed when professional composers are composing, in which the integration of the primary visual and motor areas is not necessary.

During a follow-up study for chronic hepatitis C in a 71-year-old man, a nodular lesion showed rapid growth from 1 cm to 4 cm in diameter within 3 months. Histologically, the tumor was consistent with moderately differentiated HCC, but was intermingled with nests of small round cells with scarce cytoplasm, which resembled those found in small cell carcinoma. This population formed small solid nests among the trabecular structures. Immunohistochemically the small round cell component of the tumor was strongly positive for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), chromogranin A and synaptophysin, but hepatocyte paraffin-1 (HP-1) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were negative. In contrast, HP-1 and AFP were positive, and NSE, chromogranin A and synaptophysin were negative in moderately differentiated HCC tissues. Electron microscopy revealed many intracytoplasmic neurosecretory granules in the small round cells. The labeling indexes of p53 and Ki-67 were significantly higher in the small round cell component than in the moderately differentiated HCC component. Overall, we conclude that this nodule was HCC with neuroendocrine differentiation.",valid,

The first experiment demonstrated that amplitude- and frequency-modulated tones are not appropriate stimuli to study temporal resolution as a functional of frequency region, due to the availability of other cues in addition to temporal ones. In the other experiments, thresholds for detection of sinusoidal amplitude modulation of a noise band were measured as a function of frequency region, bandwidth, and level of surrounding notched noise masker. Temporal modulation transfer functions (TMTFs) measured in low- and high-frequency regions did not differ in sensitivity or in cutoff frequency, suggesting that initial ""critical band"" filtering did not affect temporal resolution. When the upper cutoff frequency of the noise was held constant, TMTF sensitivity increased with noise bandwidth, while the cutoff frequency of the TMTF did not show measurable change. These results are consistent with the predictions of an envelope detector model if peripheral filtering in the lower-frequency range is assumed to be approximately twice as wide as that estimated by measuring thresholds for a tone in notched noise. Restricting the listening region with notched noise increased thresholds for low modulation frequencies but not for high. This is consistent with other data showing that upward spread of excitation may increase the effective modulation depth, but only for low modulation frequencies.",valid,

Because this association was unexpected, a retrospective review of our 11-year experience was performed using a multivariant computer analysis. The cohort consisted of 54 newborns with gastroschisis. All infants with omphalocele were excluded. Ten of 54 infants (18.5%) developed NEC as defined by classical clinical findings and pneumatosis intestinalis. Twenty-one distinct episodes of NEC occurred with up to three episodes (mean, 2.1) per patient. Twenty of the 21 episodes were successfully treated nonoperatively. Two infants developed pneumoperitoneum, one of whom underwent laparotomy upon which no perforation or intestinal infarction was found. Eight of the ten patients survived--a survival rate no different than for the remainder of the study group. Neither of the two deaths was attributable to NEC. The NEC was atypical in that no significant relationship was established with known predisposing conditions such as prematurity or low Apgar scores. Suspected risk factors such as time of feeding, type of closure, type of formula, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and composition of TPN were not statistically related. Significant associations included concurrent TPN associated cholestatic liver disease in nine of the ten infants, antecedent intestinal surgery other than abdominal wall closure in five of the ten infants, and delay in initiation of enteral feedings (greater than 30 days) in eight of ten infants. In addition, the NEC occurred significantly later (range, 32 to 79 days; mean, 52 days) in the clinical course than usual; in fact, three of ten infants were rehospitalized with NEC following discharge.

870203,"The question of whether mechanical moments participate in ultrastructural development of the heart cannot be decided by examining heart tissue samples during embryonic life, for during maturation processes in vivo mechanical factors are always present. The significance of mechanical moments can only be investigated in a system which allows a distinction to be made between pulsations of heart myocytes under conditions of contraction against and under conditions of contraction without mechanical stress. This double possibility is provided by cell culture. An example in which mechanical influences are absent are the so-called ""minihearts""; these are cell agglomerations which are detached from the culture substrate. Their cell contractions do not act against any mechanical resistance. In the electron microscope they show abundant filaments, Z-line material and membrane specializations. The highest degree of development, however, does not exceed that characterizing the cells with which the cultures were started. Even some dedifferentiation and degeneration are apparent in the minihearts. No intercalated discs can be found even after 12 weeks, provided that the culture had been started with really isolated cells. The representatives in culture of a myocyte's connection with the heart's mechanical action are the cords, along which attached points alternate with free strands. The pulsation of these strands is restrained during each contraction by their ends, which are fixed on the culture substrate. Thus, the myocytes contract against a resistance, and in this respect their pulsations resemble those of the heart, in which the myocytes' contraction acts against the pressure of the blood. The myocyte culture under these mechanical condition, after a culture time of 10 weeks, produces electron micrographs of mature cells with reduced cytoplasm, aligned mitochondria and fibrils and intercalated discs.",valid,

The main role in the care of the patients was played by neurologists from the public health service, but the number of house visits provided by physicians of the basic health service was slightly higher than that provided by neurologists. Among the physicians working in medical cooperative or in private practice only the dentists had a more important role in providing of health services to the patients. Thirty percent of patients had no medical visits in outpatient clinics of social health service within a year preceding the study, despite a need for them, and 9% of them had no house visits of physicians. The percent of patients informed about the usefulness of motor rehabilitation treatment was at least half the proportion of patients with walking disturbances.

Here we examine the psychosocial consequences of the epidemic. Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates. Those affected are likely to experience psychological effects due to the traumatic course of the infection, fear of death and experience of witnessing others dying. Survivors can also experience psychosocial consequences due to feelings of shame or guilt (e.g. from transmitting infection to others) and stigmatization or blame from their communities. At the community level, a cyclical pattern of fear occurs, with a loss of trust in health services and stigma, resulting in disruptions of community interactions and community break down. Health systems in affected countries were severely disrupted and overstretched by the outbreak and their capacities were significantly reduced as almost 900 health-care workers were infected with Ebola and more than 500 died. The outbreak resulted in an increased need for health services, reduced quality of life and economic productivity and social system break down. It is essential that the global response to the outbreak considers both acute and long-term psychosocial needs of individuals and communities. Response efforts should involve communities to address psychosocial need, to rebuild health systems and trust and to limit stigma.

CBF decline is present in AD while the number of affected CNS systems is still quite small. The step-by-step evolution of AD mirrors a brain that progressively becomes ischemic. Areas related to memory function (hippocampus, temporal lobe cortex and vicinity) are bound to suffer first because of their particularly vulnerable blood supply.

The baseline blood pressure for hypertensive patients (149 +/- 4/85 +/- 2 mmHg) was significantly higher than that for normotensive patients (119 +/- 3/71 +/- 2 mmHg).

The current study examined the sequencing of substances relative to inhalants and the post-initiation correlates of inhalant use between youth and young adulthood in nationally representative Add Health data. Analyses examined the relationship of substance of initiation to use of other substances, as well as an examination of the relationship between substance use and consequences. The analyses suggest that (a) those initiating their substance use careers with inhalants often go on to use hard drugs, (b) inhalant use likely occurs after alcohol and marijuana use, and (c) inhalant use during adolescence was associated with health and criminal consequences in both adolescence and young adulthood.",valid,3671352
15739453,"A gas chromatographic method for the measurement of enriching characters of adsorbents used in preconcentration of organic compounds from air samples was studied. The character parameters suggested in this study include adsorption parameters (breakthrough volume or maximum sample volume) and desorption ones (minimum flashing volume and the lowest desorption temperature). The parameters of some low-molecular-mass compounds such as alcohols, saturated hydrocarbons, aromatics, esters and halohydrocarbons on GDX-301 were measured by using elution GC method. The maximum sample volumes of all the 20 compounds (with exception of methanol) got from these experiments are not less than 0.8 L at 35 degrees C for sampling tube (filled with 2 g GDX-301) and 0.3 L at 0 degrees C for focus tube (with 0.14 g GDX-301). The corresponding minimum flashing volumes of less than 177 mL and 13 mL respectively are needed to complete desorption at 180 degrees C, and the lowest desorption temperatures of not over 180 degrees C and 157 degrees C at flashing volume of 180 mL and 30 mL are lower than the maximum allowable operating temperature (250 degrees C) of GDX-301. The results showed that GDX-301 is a good adsorbent for enrichment of the organic compounds mentioned above. The following operating conditions are recommended: using the above sampling tube and focus tube, actual sample volume < or = 0.8 L, adsorption temperature < or = 35 degrees C and focus temperature 0 degrees C, desorption for 6 min from sampling tube and 1 min from focus tube at 180 degrees C with flashing rate 30 mL/min.

8933365,"The influence of plasma corticosterone concentration on serotonin (5-HT) turnover in the dorsal hippocampus was investigated. The experiments were performed in freely moving male Wistar rats in their home cage. Blood samples were taken via a permanent jugular vein catheter to determine plasma corticosterone levels. Extracellular levels of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxy-indole acetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured using in vivo microdialysis. The rats received an intravenous (i.v.) infusion of the steroid synthesis-inhibitor metyrapone (150 mg/kg/ml) in order to manipulate circulating corticosterone levels. Three hours later, the monoamine oxidase inhibitor pargyline (15 mg/kg/2 ml i.v.) was administered to produce an accumulation of extracellular 5-HT. Pargyline administration led to a four fold increase in 5-HT levels, while reducing 5-HIAA by 45%. Metyrapone pretreatment blocked the pargyline-induced rise in plasma corticosterone to baseline levels and diminished the pargyline-induced increase in 5-HT, without affecting 5-HIAA levels. Thus, the data suggest that a decrease in availability of corticosterone for its receptors by metyrapone diminished the 5-HT synthesis rate. Since plasma corticosterone levels during this blockade are still low, it is assumed that brain glucocorticoid receptor occupation is reduced, while mineralocorticoid receptors are still substantially occupied. Therefore the present results support the hypothesis that corticosterone through glucocorticoid receptor activation enhances 5-HT synthesis rate and release in the dorsal hippocampus.",valid,

10191766,"Immunophenotypic studies are essential to distinguish acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) from minimally differentiated acute myeloid leukemia (AMLM0) and to classify ALL into immunologic subtypes. Frequently, immunophenotyping identifies myeloid antigen expression in ALL, causing a potential diagnostic problem. To evaluate the immunophenotype of ALL, we studied 210 cases of pediatric and adult ALL by flow cytometry and compared the results with the French-American-British (FAB) Cooperative Group classification and the karyotypic findings. Myeloid-associated antigens were expressed in 78 (45.6%) of precursor B-cell ALL cases. Pediatric precursor B ALLs had a higher frequency of myeloid antigen expression than did adult cases. All mature B-cell ALL cases were negative for TdT and myeloid antigens. Myeloid antigen expression was less frequent in T-cell ALL cases compared with precursor B-cell ALL cases. Of the 192 cases submitted for cytogenetic analysis, 147 were abnormal. The most common chromosomal translocation was the Philadelphia chromosome, which was more likely to have L2 blast morphology and a precursor B immunophenotype. Myeloid antigen expression was present in 70.8% of Ph-positive cases (P = .008). Chromosome rearrangements involving 11q23 also showed an increased frequency of myeloid antigen expression. Chromosome translocations involving regions of T-cell receptor genes were present in 24% of T-cell ALL cases.

35704637,"Mutation-induced protein misfolding of pancreatic secretory enzymes and consequent endoplasmic reticulum stress can cause chronic pancreatitis. A recent study revealed that cigarette smoke also increases the risk of the disease through endoplasmic reticulum stress. Here, we investigated the cumulative cellular effect of the G233E misfolding human pancreatic lipase variant and hydroquinone; a main toxic constituent of cigarette smoke, using mammalian cell lines. We found that hydroquinone reduces cell viability on a dose-dependent manner through programmed cell death, and diminishes lipase secretion without affecting its expression. Interestingly, hydroquinone decreased the viability more markedly in cells expressing the G233E lipase variant, than in cells producing wild-type lipase. The more substantial viability loss was due to increased endoplasmic reticulum stress, as demonstrated by elevated levels of X-box binding protein 1 mRNA splicing and immunoglobulin binding protein, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 and C/EBP homologous protein expression. Unresolved endoplasmic reticulum stress, and especially up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein were likely responsible for the increased cell death. Our observations demonstrated that the combination of hydroquinone and misfolding pancreatic lipase variant promote increased levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell death, which may predispose to chronic pancreatitis.",valid,9200355

27320114,"Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a major oncological emergency. TLS is common in patients with hematological malignancies, but it can occur across a spectrum of cancer types. Germ cell tumors (GCT) have rapid cancer cell turnover and often present with bulky metastasis. The international TLS expert consensus panel has recommended guidelines for a medical decision tree to assign low, intermediate and high risk to patients with cancer at risk for TLS. GCT is classified as intermediate risk for TLS, and the patients who have other TLS risks factors are classified to be at high risk for TLS. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 67 patients with metastatic GCT who were treated with induction chemotherapy at Tsukuba University Hospital between 2000 and 2013. Thirty-one, 15 and 21 patients were classified with good-, intermediate- and poor-prognosis disease, respectively, according to the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group criteria. Twelve patients (18%) were classified to be at high risk for TLS, and two patients were treated with allopurinol or rasburicase as prophylaxes for TLS. They did not show progression to laboratory TLS (L-TLS). In the remaining 10 TLS high-risk patients, three (30%) patients developed L-TLS after chemotherapy and started receiving oral allopurinol. As a result, no patients developed clinical TLS (C-TLS). In this study, 30% of TLS-high risk patients developed L-TLS without prophylactic treatment. Therefore, it is important to conduct TLS-risk stratification and consider prophylaxis such as rasburicase for advanced GCT patients at induction chemotherapy.",valid,

31054332,"It is well known that performance on a trial is flexibly modulated by preceding trial congruency in tasks that require cognitive control, such as the Stroop task, referred to as the conflict adaptation effect (CAE). The CAE indicates that conflict on the preceding trial leads to enhanced cognitive control, leading to more efficient regulation of current conflict. The present study aimed to identify neural mechanisms implicated in individual differences in CAEs. The participants performed a version of the color-word Stroop task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment and were divided into two groups according to the magnitude of behavioral CAE: one exhibiting the CAE only in congruent trials and the other in both congruent and incongruent trials. The imaging results showed different activations in the pre-supplementary motor area for the Stroop effect between groups. Importantly, group differences in activation for the preceding trials were observed in several prefrontal regions including the bilateral frontopolar, dorsolateral prefrontal, and rostro-dorsal cingulate cortices. More interestingly, analyses of the preceding trials suggest that the frontopolar cortex is involved in conflict resolution through higher-order cognitive control strategies that are closely associated with subsequent conflict. The current study provides new evidence of the role of the frontopolar cortex in conflict adaptation.",valid,

The objective of our study was to determine if inappropriate administration of antibiotics could create conditions that would increase the rates of surgical infection. We hypothesized that sub-MIC levels of vancomycin would increase Staphylococcus aureus growth, biofilm formation, and rates of infection. S. aureus MRSA and MSSA strains were used for all experiments. Bacteria were grown planktonically and monitored using spectrophotometry. Quantitative agar culture was used to measure planktonic and biofilm bacterial burden. A mouse abscess model was used to confirm phenotypes in vivo. In the planktonic growth assay, increases in bacterial burden at ¼ MIC vancomycin were observed in USA300 JE2 by 72 h. Similar findings were observed with ½ MIC in Newman and SH1000. For biofilm formation, USA300 JE2 at ¼ and ½ MIC vancomycin increased biofilm formation by approximately 1.3- and 2.3-fold respectively at 72 h as compared to untreated controls. Similar findings were observed with Newman and SH1000 with a 2.4-fold increase in biofilm formation at ½ MIC vancomycin. In a mouse abscess model, there was a 1.2-fold increase with sub-MIC vancomycin at 3 days post infection. Our study showed that Sub-optimal vancomycin dosing promoted S. aureus planktonic growth and biofilm formation, phenotypic measures of bacterial virulence. This phenotype induced by sub-MIC levels of vancomycin was also observed to increase rates of infection and pathogenesis in our mouse model. Risks of exposure to sub-MIC concentrations with vancomycin in surgical procedures are greater as there is decreased bioavailability in tissue in comparison to other antibiotics. This highlights the importance of proper antibiotic selection, stewardship, and dosing for both surgical prophylaxis and treatment of infection.",valid,10030625

The progression of pigment disappearance and the (stereochemical) nature of the product are monitored by chromatography, UV-visible absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Upon reduction, albumin-bound biliverdin IX alpha, with a slight preference for the P-helicity, affords the corresponding bound bilirubin IX alpha -with an M-chirality conformation. The complex is reduced at -0.64 V (vs. SCE; 8% DMSO), only a little shifted compared to reduction of free biliverdin IX alpha under the same conditions. In contrast, an analogous bilirubin IX alpha-serum albumin complex is essentially inert towards cathodic reduction under conditions where free bilirubin IX alpha is reduced, indicating a better shielding by the protein of the bilirubin IX alpha molecule from the electrode surface. The presence of relative position (as in the biliverdins IX alpha and XIII alpha) or absence (as in mesobiliverdin IX alpha) of vinyl groups in the pigment does not have a significant effect upon its electroreduction behaviour, indicating that the process is not sensitive to the subtle differences imposed by vinyl groups upon the structure of the corresponding biliverdin-albumin complexes.",valid,

In our study, urinary porphyrin concentrations were examined in normal children 8-18 years-old from a reanalysis of data provided from a randomized, prospective clinical trial that was designed to evaluate the potential health consequences of prolonged exposure to Hg from dental amalgam fillings (the parent study). Our analysis examined dose-dependent correlations between increasing Hg exposure from dental amalgams and urinary porphyrins utilizing statistical models with adjustments for the baseline level (i.e. study year 1) of the following variables: urinary Hg, each urinary porphyrin measure, gender, race, and the level of lead (Pb) in each subject's blood. Significant dose-dependent correlations between cumulative exposure to Hg from dental amalgams and urinary porphyrins associated with Hg body-burden (pentacarboxyporphyrin, precoproporphyrin, and coproporphyrin) were observed. Overall, 5-10% increases in Hg-associated porphyrins for subjects receiving an average number of dental amalgam fillings in comparison to subjects receiving only composite fillings were observed over the 8-year course of the study. In contrast, no significant correlations were observed between cumulative exposure to Hg from dental amalgams and urinary porphyrins not associated with Hg body-burden (uroporphyrin, heptacarboxyporphyrin, and hexacarboxyporphyrin).

2844953,"Serum incubated with purified EBV was found to contain C3 cleavage fragments characteristic of C3c. Since the cofactors necessary for such cleavage of C3b by factor I are not normally present in serum, EBV was tested for factor I cofactor activity. Purified EBV from both human and marmoset EBV-producing cell lines was found to act as a cofactor for the factor I-mediated breakdown C3b to iC3b and iC3b to C3c and C3dg. EBV also acted as a cofactor for the factor I-mediated cleavage of C4b to iC4b and iC4b to C4c and C4d. EBV from both the human and marmoset cell lines accelerated the decay of the alternative pathway C3 convertase. The classical pathway C3 convertase was unaffected. Multiple lines of evidence eliminated the possibility that marmoset or human CR1 was responsible for the functional activities of EBV preparations. The spectrum of activities was different from CR1 in that EBV and EBV-expressing cell lines failed to rosette with C3b or particles bearing C3b, the primary functional assay for CR1, and EBV did not accelerate classical pathway C3 convertase decay, another property of CR1. In addition, CR1 could not be detected immunologically on marmoset or human EBV-expressing cells and mAbs to CR1 failed to alter EBV-produced decay acceleration and factor I cofactor activities, although the antibodies blocked the same CR1-dependent functional activities. The multiple complement regulatory activities exhibited by purified EBV derived from human and marmoset cells differ from those of any of the known C3 or C4 regulatory proteins. These various activities would be anticipated to provide survival value for the virus by subverting complement- and cell-dependent host defense mechanisms.",valid,2189017
37706766,"Fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) can achieve noninvasive, high-contrast, high-sensitivity three-dimensional imaging in vivo by relying on a variety of fluorescent molecular probes, and has excellent clinical transformation prospects in the detection of tumors in vivo. However, the limited surface fluorescence makes the FMT reconstruction have some ill-posedness, and it is difficult to obtain the ideal reconstruction effect. In this paper, two different emission fluorescent probes and",valid,

2383353,"Systemic absorption of water-soluble and water-insoluble drugs through human burn wounds was compared. Serum levels of sulphadiazine were estimated after application of silver sulphadiazine (water-insoluble) cream, sulphadiazine (water-insoluble) cream and sodium sulphadiazine (water-soluble) cream. It was found that the absorption of sodium sulphadiazine was greater than that of sulphadiazine or silver sulphadiazine.",valid,

1593194,"Lateral elbow pain syndrome is probably a fairly common condition and known to be resistant to conservative treatments. It is suggested that this syndrome is caused by entrapment of the radial nerve. Thirty patients with lateral elbow pain syndrome, in which entrapment of the radial nerve was diagnosed, have been operated upon to release the radial nerve at the elbow. There were 9 men and 21 women. Their age ranged from 17 to 64 with an average of 42.5. Twenty one of thirty nerves were entraped by the arcade of Frohse or other soft tissues. Nine nerves were adherent to the tissues overlying the radial head. Follow-up has been from six months to two years and eight months. Postoperative results were excellent in 16 patients, good in 11, fair in two and poor in one. These results would indicate that entrapment of the radial nerve at the elbow is considered as a cause of lateral elbow pain syndrome.",valid,
16739407,"Anopheles gambiae s.s. Giles accepted a range of agarose gels, varying from 0.5 to 8% (wt:vol), for oviposition; laid more eggs on 0.5% agarose gels than on moist filter paper or on drier agarose; and laid equal numbers of eggs on 0.5% agarose gels and distilled water. Larvae hatched on agarose gel substrates and crawled onto the surface of moist agarose gels, but they tended only to burst the egg cap and remain within the egg case on drier gels. A mixture of cultured bacteria, originating from a natural larval habitat of An. gambaiae s.s. in western Kenya, was classified by 16S rDNA sequence analysis, and then this mixture or individual colonies from it was used as odor sources in ovipositional experiments with agarose substrates. Of 61 sequences from a mixed clone sequence library, most (78%) were Pseudomonas strains, whereas the remainder were Stenotrophomonas, Enterobacter, Pantoea, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, and Bacillus. Oviposition was significantly reduced when mixtures of bacterial colonies of these strains, or a lawn of colonies of a field isolate of S. maltophilia, was presented. Oviposition was neither reduced nor enhanced when field isolates of Pseudomonas putida or Pseudomonas alcaligenes colonies were presented. These results suggest that gravid An. gambiae females are sensitive to bacterial-derived odors emanating from cultured bacteria from natural larval habitats and that some bacterial odors may be repellent.",valid,

Nursing staff, as front-line healthcare professionals, are often the first present at cardiovascular arrests and respond by providing CPR. Their training has an impact on the efficiency of CPR and consequently on health outcomes; thus, assessment of their status in that respect may provide useful information for decision making.",valid,
